It normally precedes larger vessels at the start of a mission. It has a crew of one and little plunder value.","STR_MEDIUM_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA":"A small non-combat vessel that poses little threat to your craft. Used by Academicians and Traders in most missions. The crew ranges from 4 to 7 members, half of them civilian.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 39","STR_LARGE_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA":"A general purpose vessel used by Academicians and Traders for more demanding missions. It can hold a crew of 5 to 11, always including an Engineer. Mostly harmless.{NEWLINE}Max DPM: 52","STR_HARVESTER_UFOPEDIA":"Aptly named, the Shrine Ship is the primary vessel of the Church, always commanded by a Reverend. It can hold a crew of up to around 16, armed with laser weapons and flamethrowers.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 10; SHIELDS: 200 (Reg x1); Max DPM: 172","STR_ABDUCTOR_UFOPEDIA":"Although not really a warship, this vessel represents an elite level of technology and holds elite crew, so it's better not underestimated. It is normally used for special missions.{NEWLINE}SHIELDS: 500 (Reg x3); Max DPM: 164","STR_TERROR_SHIP_UFOPEDIA":"This is just a large dropship. Its weapons might not be the most powerful around, but it is armored and can take a lot of punishment. However, shooting it down will grant a lot of infamy.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 5; Max DPM: 156","STR_BATTLESHIP_UFOPEDIA":"The Cruiser is amongst the largest and most powerful craft around, manned by the best-equipped personnel. To make things even worse, it was designed with boarding actions in mind and can be used to assault our Hideouts directly.{NEWLINE}ARMOR: 25; Max DPM: 272","STR_SUPPLY_SHIP_UFOPEDIA":"Supply Ships are used to fly regular supply runs to enemy Secret Bases. They can be easily attacked on the ground when doing so, but be warned - the sensitive equipment they carry is not supposed to fall into enemy hands, so the self-destruct system will explode the power core after 20 turns or so, vaporising the ship. Plasma venting warns that the explosion is imminent.","STR_ACCESS_LIFT_UFOPEDIA":"The access lift is always the first facility to be constructed at a new hideout. An easy guess what it does. Or so I hope. OK. It allows access - to both welcomed and unwelcomed guests. Especially the rude kind who, when you ignore the doorbell, blow the door out. It cannot be made fully secure, though, as we need the traffic of workers and slaves who live aboveground.","STR_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA":"A simple 4-way passage, can be built to link outlying parts of a Hideout to the piping and power grid. It also grates off the sewers, making them impassable to enemies.","STR_FIRE_PIT_UFOPEDIA":"Anyone who carelessly strolls into this seemingly normal corridor will trigger firebombs hidden in its walls. Even if they don't roast the trespasser, they'll make them pause for a moment at least. Warning: the fuses aren't infallible and sometimes they'll fail to arm immediately.","STR_GAS_CHAMBER_UFOPEDIA":"This room is equipped with hidden bombs, releasing powerful sleeping gas when someone walks close to them. Capturing prisoners has never been so easy, unless they wear gas masks, that is.","STR_STILL_UFOPEDIA":"A masterpiece of technology, a symbol of triumph of mind over matter, a place of happiness. All in one, albeit a bit smelly, facility. Without it present on-site, a Hideout cannot produce any alcoholic beverages. In addition to providing this functionality, it provides workspace for 10 Runts, but with no Workshops present, you can use it only to make alcohol.","STR_LUXURY_SPA_UFOPEDIA":"Besides the huge swimming pool (yaaay!), this facility contains all sorts of entertainment, recreational and training improvements: a fighting ring, a games terrace (with a great view), an arcade room, a sauna and more. It not only allows 30 hands to improve their physical fitness, but might be useful for training our auxilia as well, and generally increases the civilizational and sanitational level of a Hideout, thus improving wounds recovery by 0.65% of Max HP daily. Dress code of this facility says 'the less, the better', a Swimsuit is the maximum allowed. Only a single Spa is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 4 Slaves and 6 Slave Maids.","STR_GYM_ROOM_UFOPEDIA":"This building houses a special, dangerous training course, which, aided by certain chemical substances, improves trainee's statistics on a daily basis. The facility consists of a shooting range (with targets that return fire), a boxing ring, some boring weights and last but not least, an arcade room! However, the course is very intensive and each Dojo can service only 5 Hands at a time. Wounded Hands do not benefit from the Dojo until fully healed. Dojo can't train stats past a certain threshold: 66 (Strength, Health, Throwing); 85 (TUs, Firing); 100 (Melee, Stamina). Reactions and Bravery aren't trained.","STR_LIBRARY_UFOPEDIA":"This luxury facility is used to store all kinds of books, paper, crystal and electronic, romance, adventure, erotica and even an occasional arcane work. It can serve as a workplace for a single Brainer, but what's more important, it's absolutely required for some of the more fancy Research and Manufacture projects to be even possible. However, good books are hard to find and extremely expensive, so establishing such a place is a major expenditure (a waste of money, some would say).","STR_MESS_HALL_UFOPEDIA":"No Hideout is complete without this establishment! It serves fresh drinks from the Still (requires one to function), slightly increasing  wound recovery speed of our Hands (especially those with high Health). It is also a cultural centre, providing a proper forum for public discussion (we're no longer limited to the Hangar!) and workspace for 1 Brainer; without it, many cultural advances and some mission opportunities will be impossible to research. Only a single Mess Hall can be built per Hideout.","STR_MED_BAY_UFOPEDIA":"A general medical facility, that will speed up the wound recovery of all Hands in a Hideout - for a price. By healing an extra 0.5 HP per day, it effectively cuts the downtime by a third. Your Hands may complain that the recovery is being rushed, but they won't scoff at the company of nurses, instead of ol' tired faces in the bunkhouse. Only a single Sick Bay can be built per Hideout, but the health recovery bonus stacks with any bonuses provided by similar facilities (as if we know anything about this, ho, ho). Gives workspace for a single very eager Brainer.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 10 Medical Supplies.","STR_SURGERY_ROOM_UFOPEDIA":"This one requires a Library present to operate. Note the double meaning of the word, ha, ha. Anyhow. Various surgical procedures need such a specialized environment to be performed, allowing all wounded to recover extra 0.25 HP plus 1% of the soldier's Max HP daily, almost halving recovery times. This facility also houses 2 Brainers. Only a single Surgery Room is allowed per Hideout.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 3 Surgery Units.","STR_CLONING_CENTRE_UFOPEDIA":"This building will enable us to grow all sorts of living matter, from organs to whole organisms. Even if we haven't devised any creatures yet, it will help with medical care, recovering 0.75 HP daily to all Hands present on-site. The power of Creation is now ours to command! Up to ten Runts can work in this facility, which requires a Surgery Room present to operate. Only a single Cloning Centre is allowed per Hideout.","STR_STUDY_ROOM_UFOPEDIA":"If we want to seriously increase our research speed, this is our best bet. Each of these facilities allows 2 Brainers to work on any project of your choice. However, a Hideout intended to house them first needs at least one of each: Library, Surgery Room, Still (to help with abstract thinking) and Power Plant.","STR_COMPUTER_CORE_UFOPEDIA":"This facility houses a battery of obscenely-expensive, powerful computers, allowing us to crunch megatons of numbers. It can be used to conduct hacking, just like the Lab, and gives workspace for 3 extra Brainers. This extra brainpower may come in handy, as the facility is required (along with a Library) to pursue the 'Higher Studies' research project, that'll allow us to unlock even higher technologies, but is likely to be extremely slow to complete.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 20 Slave AIs.","STR_REFINERY_UFOPEDIA":"Allows manufacture of Chemicals and advanced chemical weapons. Provides workspace for 10 Runts and lab space for 1 Brainer. Requires an Extractor present to be built.","STR_MINT_UFOPEDIA":"Provides tools for making counterfeit money. Having it present at a Hideout allows you to ctrl+P all your financial problems away just like you were the Traders' Guild, how cool is that? Provides workspace for 10 Runts.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires an Industrial Scanner.","STR_SUMMONING_CIRCLE_UFOPEDIA":"This arcane facility allows us to perform magic rites needed to get all sorts of magical stuff (not all magical stuff requires it, though). It provides workspace for 10 Runts for that purpose. It also provides workspace for 3 Brainers. Just be careful during Hideout Defenses, who knows what can be accidentally summoned amidst the ensuing chaos...{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 10 Hypno Pannels. Only a single Summoning Circle allowed per Hideout.","STR_POWER_PLANT_UFOPEDIA":"This facility, while quite expensive to build, immediately starts to be a cash earner since it can be used to power other facilities, and any excess electricity can be sold. On top of that, we need this facility for any manufacturing process that requires unusually high energy density.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 2 Ship Engines.","STR_FUSION_REACTOR_UFOPEDIA":"There is little gain from understanding the containment field physics if we can't put it to practical use. A Fusion Reactor installed at a Hideout lets us manufacture ammunition and other equipment dependent on this technology. It additionally allows us to power the most advanced defensive facilities and provides research opportunities for 2 Brainers. However it needs a Power Station to run.","STR_WELL_UFOPEDIA":"A place of industry, it has a shaft that reaches into the bowels of the Earth and allows us to extract various resources from the slimy nukage that keeps us all healthily radiated. It is also equipped with some tools that'll allow up to 20 Runts to produce various simple equipment. Take note that stuff requiring intricate tools, like firearms, cannot be manufactured here. A single Hideout can support at most 3 Extractors.{NEWLINE}WARNING: After a project is started ('AYE' was clicked), cancelling it will destroy ALL components allocated. To avoid it, be sure to dismiss unwanted projects immediately by the 'BEGONE' button. The 'REFUND' button, if present, returns components and money.","STR_INDUSTRIAL_PRINTER_UFOPEDIA":"This is a Workshop-type facility. While less space-effective than an equivalent of 4 Workshops (providing workspace for a mere 100 Runts), it is definitely more cost-effective. Even more importantly, it allows manufacturing of items with very intricate internal structure, especially advanced armor suits.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 3 Industrial Scanners.","STR_FACTORY_UFOPEDIA":"Look how far we've made it, Capn'. From a lousy, cramped hideout, to this - our own centre of industrial production. It can provide workspace for up to 450 runts, while cutting operation costs by almost a half as compared to a Workshop when fully staffed. A Factory requires a Power Station.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 500 Plastasteel.","STR_BURROW_UFOPEDIA":"A stylish (and drafty) general-use cave dwelling. Can house up to 10 people, as well as 10 animals (tamed or otherwise). It also provides 25 storage space.","STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_UFOPEDIA":"This is where we live, eat, recover from wounds and do all sorts of (better left unsaid) stuff to fight the endless boredom. Each block can hold up to 25 free people, be it hands, runts or brainers.","STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_SMALL_UFOPEDIA":"Small and cheap radar facility with 10 bunks and 25 storage space, ideal for backwater hideouts. It is of a budget variety, with a 650 nautical miles detection radius, yet it can detect any flying object within that radius with a 100% accuracy (in ideal conditions...) with scans being made every half hour sharp.","STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_LARGE_UFOPEDIA":"We have designed a larger and more efficient version of the Barracks, with extra creature comforts to boot (fresh from the Junkyard). It can house up to 130 people and contains a small storage (25 space). However, as all this junk is quite expensive, the facility is less than dirt-cheap.","STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_ADVANCED_UFOPEDIA":"This state-of-the-art facility is environmentally sealed and, thanks to better ergonomics and top-notch creature comforts, allows us to squeeze 35 people in while still granting them good night's sleep - if that's what they want, that is. It also features a defensive laser cannon mounted on top of it. Still it is encouraged to send the occupants to off-barracks activities as often as possible, there is only that much overcrowding people can take before they start killing each other.","STR_GENERAL_STORES_LARGE_UFOPEDIA":"Bigger is better, ain't it? These huge vaults allow us to store more loot than a statistical pirate can count (namely, 550 units).","STR_GENERAL_STORES_ARMORED_UFOPEDIA":"This advanced storage facility can house 150 units of wares and/or warez, and is defended by an autonomous anti-aircraft mounting.","STR_LABORATORY_UFOPEDIA":"Oi Cap'n, here you see the fabled Science Lab of old we found in here! No touching stuff! It'll bite you! We can discover ancient and new secrets for you - all you need is to give us Brainers an order! This be a real treasure - here we have the tools to invent new stuff, make sense of old stuff and interrogate prisoners. If we had no Laboratory, we'd been just common bandits. We can cram inside up to 15 really expensive people before they'll start killing each other. Researched items will be destroyed or taken away by the Brainers, with rare exceptions.","STR_WORKSHOP_UFOPEDIA":"A real workshop, armed with modern tools, is needed to manufacture anything that looks more like a laser gun than a stone axe (to do the latter, an Extractor is enough, or sometimes even some unused space in a Still). Maximum capacity is 30 runts.","STR_SMALL_RADAR_SYSTEM_UFOPEDIA":"Without radars, you are effectively blind. Or at least one-eyed, as detecting any prey would require patrolling the skies with your craft. This radar is a large version of a hi-resolution system mounted on crafts. A full sweep takes 30 minutes and automatically detects any craft within the range of 1250 nautical miles.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires the 'Communications' technology.","STR_LARGE_RADAR_SYSTEM_UFOPEDIA":"With a range of 2000 nautical miles, this device covers a huge area, but costs helluva money. However, it can be also used to jam the navigational devices of landing enemy craft, hopefully making them crash.","STR_FLAK_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA":"A decent-sized anti-aircraft cannon, or three, can fend off some less powerful ships from attacking our base. The facility also contains gun crew barracks, housing 10 people.","STR_SAM_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA":"This facility greets any unwelcomed guests with a volley of Stingray missiles. A bit low damage for the cost, but a successful hit is assured. Includes a small crew compartment for 5 occupants.","STR_MISSILE_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA":"A silo hosting Avalanche nuclear missiles, ready to greet any unwelcomed guests. They'll obliterate smaller landing ships in a single salvo. However, the missiles have only a small window of opportunity to fire, unless we want to nuke our own base, and still, several hits are needed to destroy military-class vessels, and each of these silos will have only a single chance to fire.","STR_LASER_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA":"A stationary battery of heavy lascannons might not be as imposing as a missile silo, but it is much more accurate and much cheaper to maintain.","STR_GAUSS_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA":"Compared to other defense systems, a railgun battery can boast high firepower but is quite expensive to maintain.","STR_ARMORY_UFOPEDIA":"Only a single facility is allowed per base, and it needs a Power Plant. It provides the hideout with unerring defensive fire, as well as 100 Storage and 10 Workspace units. Most importantly, it allows us to build unique items, available only here (such as Battle Tank M).","STR_GENERAL_STORES_UFOPEDIA":"All equipment, guns, munitions, treasures and assorted junk are placed in Vaults, including equipment assigned to craft in hangars. You won't be able to buy anything on the Black Market and any loot you get from the battlefield needs to be immediately sold while the Vaults are full. Each can hold up to 75 units of storage, which translates into 15 ship reactor cores or almost 400 rifle-sized guns.","STR_ALIEN_CONTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA":"Each cell block has space for 15 special guests who can be released for ransom - either normally (Fence), or after robbing them of their possessions first (with a better yield than from a dead corpse), if it's worth it; to do that, check the Robbery category in the Workshop. The numbers represent: 1. armor parts; 2. faction related stuff; 3. common merchandise. You will also get ransom money (in Blue Chips), but, since they're damaged goods, only half the normal value. To rob a prisoner, you need to interrogate them first. Interrogated prisoners, as long as they're honorable, are released in exchange for their information.","STR_PLASMA_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA":"Plasma beam defenses provide powerful and efficient protection against incursion by hostile craft. However the facility can't run on a standard power grid and requires a Power Station to function.","STR_FUSION_BALL_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA":"Fusion missiles are the ultimate in hideout defense. These missiles create an anti-matter implosion which destroys everything within a specific radius. However a Fusion Reactor is needed to power the facility.","STR_GRAV_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA":"The Repulsor Beam slows enemy craft attempting to land near the hideout, allowing all defense systems to fire twice.  In practice this will double the effectiveness of any defense systems. A Fusion Reactor is needed to provide necessary power. And no, building multiples won't stack.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 30 Force Circuitry.","STR_MIND_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA":"Containing a battery of Cloaking Devices we mount on our ships, this facility will drastically reduce the chances of our Hideout being spotted. Normally, the chances of being spotted rise with the number of buildings in the hideout (although there is only about 30% difference between the smallest Hideout and a fully built-up one); the Shroud will halve this chance. If we build two Shrouds, the chance will be reduced to 1/3rd, and so on - any number of them will stack, albeit with diminishing returns... but we theorize that building 21 Shrouds would render any Hideout fully undetectable.{NEWLINE}R-click on a Shroud to disable it.","STR_PSIONIC_LABORATORY_UFOPEDIA":"Here we can assess the magical aptitude of all hands on deck and help them in further developing their sorcery. The actual magical potential (henceforth called VooDoo Mastery) is equal to the VooDoo Power times VooDoo skill, so do not expect much of those who have low Power; but they at least can learn some defense against enemy dark arts here, as VooDoo Defense is equal to V.Power plus some of V.Skill. A single Voodoo School can train up to 10 students.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 10 Hypno Panels.","STR_HYPER_WAVE_DECODER_UFOPEDIA":"With this device installed, we no longer need to rely on fickle radar detection. The Decoder taps directly into encrypted communication channels and not only instantly pinpoints any craft in range, but also provides a lot of intelligence on it. The maximum range is 2000 nautical miles.{NEWLINE}Constructing this facility requires 6 Slave AIs.","STR_HANGAR_UFOPEDIA":"Each hangar can accommodate one vessel. There are facilities for maintenance, refueling and repair for the assigned craft. Each vessel stationed at a hideout must have a free hangar assigned to it which cannot be used by any other vessel, even if the assigned vessel is out on a mission. Sorry, Cap'n. The pilots and their ground crew have their bizarre rules, and we either follow them, or grow wings.","STR_CANCEL_UC":"BEGONE","STR_BUILD_NEW_BASE_UC":"NEW HIDEOUT","STR_BASE_INFORMATION":"LOGS","STR_EQUIP_CRAFT":"VESSELS","STR_BUILD_FACILITIES":"EXPAND","STR_TRANSFER_UC":"SHIP","STR_PURCHASE_RECRUIT":"BLACK MARKET","STR_SACK":"WALK THE PLANK","STR_SELL_SACK_UC":"FENCE","STR_GEOSCAPE_UC":"YER BRIDGE","STR_BUILD_NEW_BASE":"Found New Hideout","STR_CANCEL":"Begone","STR_OK":"AYE","STR_SCIENTISTS_AVAILABLE":"Brainers Available>{ALT}{0}","STR_SCIENTISTS_ALLOCATED":"Brainers Allocated>{ALT}{0}","STR_SCIENTISTS_ALLOCATED_UC":"BRAINERS ALLOCATED","STR_SCIENTISTS_AVAILABLE_UC":"BRAINERS AVAILABLE>{ALT}{0}","STR_INCREASE":"More","STR_DECREASE":"Less","STR_ENGINEERS_AVAILABLE":"Runts Available>{ALT}{0}","STR_ENGINEERS_ALLOCATED":"Runts Allocated>{ALT}{0}","STR_ENGINEERS__ALLOCATED":"Runts Allocated","STR_ENGINEERS_AVAILABLE_UC":"RUNTS AVAILABLE>{ALT}{0}","STR_ENGINEER_HOURS_TO_PRODUCE_ONE_UNIT":"{0} Work hours to produce one unit","STR_WORK_SPACE_REQUIRED":"Work Space Required>{ALT}{0}","STR_SPECIAL_MATERIALS_REQUIRED":"RESOURCES REQUIRED","STR_INCREASE_UC":"MORE","STR_DECREASE_UC":"LESS","STR_PURCHASE_HIRE_PERSONNEL":"Make Yer Purchases Now","STR_PERSONNEL_AVAILABLE_PERSONNEL_TOTAL":"PEOPLE AVAILABLE:PEOPLE TOTAL>","STR_SOLDIERS":"Hands","STR_SCIENTISTS":"Brainers","STR_ENGINEERS":"Runts","STR_STORES":"Vaults","STR_LIVING_QUARTERS":"Barracks","STR_BASE_NAME":"Name Yer New Hideout, Cap'n!","STR_SELECT_DESTINATION_BASE":"Where Ship To?","STR_GAME_OVER_1":"The Star Gods rule the Earth with divine might and an iron fist, as it has been the case for centuries. The mutant and human population alike continue their pointless lives. Even those with wealth and power are still only slaves. Nothing has changed, and nothing will. Nobody can ever challenge the eternal order of things. There will be no savior, no revolutionary... or will there be? Certainly it won't be you.","STR_GAME_OVER_2":"Your legacy has turned to ashes. Any knowledge and power you have gained is lost forever. Whoever comes after you, will have to start from scratch.","STR_VICTORY_1":"As you enter the chamber you see the Solar Governor, nothing more than a huge alien brain, the object of your quest. Defenseless now, it implores you to listen to its reasons before you make the decision to pull the trigger...","STR_VICTORY_2":"The brain speaks: 'Many millions of years ago the planet you call Mars was alive.

No planet is beyond our reach, and you can share this glory. There is a terrible danger in the cold depths of space the Stellar Empire was created to thwart. All we ask is your co-operation...","STR_VICTORY_4":"'Peace is not an option', is your answer, punctuated with a weapon discharge that puts an end to the Solar Governor. Now the entire command and control nexus, the immense cloning and fabrication facilities of Mars, the miraculous technology, everything is at your fingertips.","STR_VICTORY_5":"Your second in command approaches.

We really should avoid shooting at them - it will make our emboldened 'sponsors' very angry.","STR_VESSEL_MESSENGER_UFOPEDIA":"These ships are the smallest the Star Gods 'grace' with their presence.

Can be used to breach our Hideouts as well, thankfully their velocity in atmosphere is low enough for our point defenses to react - if we have any, that is.","STR_VESSEL_BREAKER_UFOPEDIA":"Unarmed but really fast, this stealthy vessel is used to board larger vessels and facilities, while carrying a disproportionately large boarding party. Heavy armor allows it to penetrate some defenses even if it's detected. Serious means are needed to thwart these ships if they're used against us.","STR_VESSEL_ASSAULT_TRANSPORT_UFOPEDIA":"This is a fast heavy-duty troop transport, used for both space warfare and rapid ground insertion. We can expect these to be used against our Hideouts.","STR_SYNTH_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA":"This beautiful doll is the most advanced... machine? we have ever seen, Captain. It is semi-biological, as it has all the squiggly stuff we have, but it is heavily reinforced with plastasteel ON ATOMIC SCALES. Yes, you heard right: it is a cyborg with artificial molecules and tissues rather than whole body parts. All we know for sure about this babe is that she is extremely pretty, but we expect her to be quite resilient when turned on, so to speak. To do that, however, we need to learn about techs that deal with such micro scales, both cybernetic and biological.

They are in fact poorly armed civilians who are unlikely to give us trouble, but I have to admit that they're loyal to their employers. It must be greed, Cap'n, because I can't see why anyone would be loyal to the Guild because of their great moral qualities.","STR_GUILD_TEAM_LEADER_UFOPEDIA":"These 'lords amongst men' and 'eyes of the Guild' exist to order minor Guild personnel around and are paid surprisingly well, maybe to create a position the inferiors will fight to achieve (which, as simple math shows, is impossible for most). Team Leaders are uplifted to their status for unwavering loyalty, and are otherwise too dense to be easily scared. In combat, their reactions are good but their aim is terrible.","STR_TRADER_ATTENDANT_UFOPEDIA":"This little lady feels proud and empowered by her relatively-important duties and the weapon training she received and thus will not back down that easily in a gunfight. In reality, she's just another exploited female, as her duties are just various forms of serfdom, from making drinks to cleaning other people's mess to even more degrading tasks - even if none of them leave your hands dirty. At most, a bit sticky. Don't have more regrets shooting these than about any other corporate slaves.","STR_GUILD_GUARD_UFOPEDIA":"Day-to-day Guild operations are protected by guys like these. They're little more than armed  civilians, to be honest, but their combat armor might cause some trouble. In comparison with standard Combat Armor, it is less resistant to Piercing, Cutting, Fire and Smoke, but more to Laser and especially Chem, as is typical for most Guild units.","STR_GUILD_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA":"The Trader Guild's military department, Marsec, is the largest employer of shady blokes like this one. He's not too smart and certainly isn't special forces, but he's still a tough guy who's seen a lot. Such people are paid to protect the cargo and they will. Unsurprisingly, their armor is well-made and able to protect the wearer from almost any projectile weapon, so forget using buckshot or pistols against these guys.","STR_GUILD_MEDIC_UFOPEDIA":"Bodyguards are elite henchmen, usually charged with supervising lesser security personnel or with protection of some VIP. They are as bad as they look: tough, well-trained, and mean. Their power armor can stop small arms and is impregnable to fire, gas and cold; they often carry sweet weapons too, and have valuable information about various people they fought. I wouldn't like to fight them on a regular basis, even though I think they're sexy.","STR_TRADER_PILOT_UFOPEDIA":"These dudes in funny-looking uniforms aren't actually that harmless. While nowhere as important as the Engineers, they're trained pilots and technicians, are pretty well paid, and will protect their ship with their lives - after all, losing it is going to make them lifelong debt-slaves to the Guild.","STR_TRADER_SPACEMAN_UFOPEDIA":"A breed of Guild GOs, unlucky enough to work in space. We can learn about various space-related stuff from them.{NEWLINE}In combat, expect Charm, Piercing, Explosive and Melee damage to work the best, and Fire - the worst (but still not useless).","STR_TRADER_EXTERMINATOR_UFOPEDIA":"GOs can advance within the Guild, but it is very hard for them to do so. Those especially mean and rugged sometimes become Pest Control Managers. It's a better paid job, but a dirty one if there ever was; it entails dealing - permanently - with various nasty pests, from hostile fauna and flora to mutants. The Pest Control wear light, chem-resistant, flying suits to get where no one else can and are generally much more dangerous (and enthusiastic) than GOs, but their area of expertise isn't dealing with armed and organized opposition - like us.","STR_GUILD_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA":"This guy is something more than just a deck maintenance officer, I'm telling you. Trader Engineers are important, expensive specialists, who make Guild's ships and other facilities run as smoothly as possible and are often in somewhat influential positions. They're not really warriors, but they are rich enough to carry good weapons and wear some armor, so beware.","STR_GUILD_LEADER_UFOPEDIA":"This lady ain't no small fish among the Guild, representing an actual VIP in their business. Trader Reps like her are few and only present when they are needed, so don't expect to find one behind every tree. They aren't very dangerous themselves, but they're normally protected by a large security force. Needless to say, we should capture them alive whenever possible, as the Guild will pay a lot for returning them.","STR_GUILD_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA":"These VIPs are the richest of the rich in the Guild, dealing with all the important stuff like politics and strategical business. Naturally, they are hard to come by, so capturing more of them will be a pain. Moreover, they commonly wear golden powered armors which make their bodyguards look like midgets with pointy sticks - not only hard to break, but protected against magic! Still, they hold critical information on the Guild's activity, and we can sell them back with enormous profit, so let's try to catch them all!","STR_OSIRON_LAD_UFOPEDIA":"These junior members of Osiron seem to be servants to the Academy, doing all kinds of menial work the academicians hate so much, but this picture might fool you. In actuality, the Osiron Yeomen think very little of the Academy, their duty being sworn to Osiron leaders instead. It's some sort of rite of passage they have to complete before being allowed to advance in the Osiron structure. Curiously enough, they show combat capabilities much above that of the Osiron Security cohorts, especially in melee, speed and Evasion. It seems Osiron is quite unwilling to share its best with the Academy.","STR_ACADEMY_STUDENT_UFOPEDIA":"The Academy recruits mainly from tribes and villages, even though it is normally associated with human cityfolk. These young women are given clean, snazzy clothes to appreciate their new position and enough work and study to make them stop thinking about any life they had before the Academy took it. Seems that the lower your rank is in the Academy, the more work you need to do, since Students are used for virtually everything, from running endless errands to manning dangerous posts. They're too weak and unskilled for serious labour, though, so we can only enslave them.","STR_ACADEMY_NURSE_UFOPEDIA":"Nurses are beastmasters/healers/guards who help Academy teams during their humanitarian aid missions. They're trained to aggressively assume authority over bands of confused tribals, provide first aid and manhandle any mutant who refuses to be taken to Academy's hospital for healing and further screening. Nurses carry little of value, except for their pedantically cleaned clothing, which can be torn to get bandages.","STR_SECTOID_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA":"Also called 'The Owls', they are armed people who accompany Academicians on away missions to protect them from things like us. Their combat prowess is rather poor - probably because of all the classes on wars and tactics they were forced to endure - but they get good weapons and carapace armor. Seems that they have somehow fallen from grace in Osiron and got relegated to such tasks. If you see them in battle, remember they won't go down easily, and certainly not from puny weapons like pistols!","STR_SECTOID_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA":"They're low-level helpers, carrying out surveys and minor investigations for the Academy, writing analyses and doing most of the actual Academy's work in general. They call themselves 'researchers', but many of them are more like tribals with above average wits and some fancy equipment. They rarely carry good weapons, but remember that they're tougher and more savvy than they may seem at first.","STR_SECTOID_EXPLORER_UFOPEDIA":"Explorer status is granted to members of the Academy who are exceptional enough to be given a chance of advancement into their elite: Medics, Engineers or even Espers. To test their mettle and weed out the weak, the Explorers are sent on dangerous missions, but they're also trusted with more expensive equipment, like their iconic hazmat suits.","STR_SECTOID_MEDIC_UFOPEDIA":"Academician Medics are responsible for biological surveys, as well as providing medical services to poor people when they need more recruits. They are also known to experiment on humans and perhaps even kittens. They often carry pneumatic rifles with tranquilizing darts to catch some perfect specimens like us, so remember to keep your buttocks covered when one of them is roaming around! As for our gains, Medics' knowledge about mutants will be invaluable when searching for allies.","STR_SECTOID_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA":"Engineers are common among the Academicians, as they're needed to maintain their ships, labs and other extravaganza. They are just normal peepz in light armors, but they are clever and experienced. Sometimes I wish we could keep them around for longer, but obviously we can't trust them with our tools.","STR_SECTOID_LEADER_UFOPEDIA":"So called 'espers' are mages of the Academy, able to do scary things like reading people's minds or paralyzing them with fear. Many of them are actually quite powerful and they consider themselves higher beings from us mortals, though they don't have the boobs to liken themselves to Star Gods. I'm sure we could sell this one for a nice pile of cash, but only after extracting all the information we can. Nevertheless, I'm not happy to have them in our hideout, not at all.","STR_SECTOID_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA":"Provosts are capi di tutti capi in the Academy, the only ones to speak to Star Gods personally. They are chosen from among the Espers to lead them and are therefore extremely dangerous. Needless to say, they are very rare, well protected and possess terrible magical powers. Which doesn't mean we'll stop trying to capture more of them!","STR_CHURCH_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA":"These Neophytes are mostly recruited from among the poor and forsaken, baited by the Reverends with promises of a better life. Then they get a nasty VooDoo treatment, which reinforces their warm feelings towards The Church and, by extension, Star Gods. Neophytes are still on a level of street urchins, but the Church is rich and provides them with good weapons.","STR_CHURCH_BOY_UFOPEDIA":"These very young men dutifully serve the Church's priesthood in all areas where being an adult is not a requirement. It is a bit regretful (and hurtful to our reputation) if we're forced to kill them, but maybe we don't have to, as they have no chance against our special skills, if you know what I mean, Cap'n. If all else fails, a stun baton would do as well.","STR_CHURCH_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA":"This is what you get when you overdose a Neophyte with propaganda and other drugs: a Zealot. Zealots believe themselves to be directly controlled by the will of the Star Gods and, somehow, this makes them almost completely fearless. Despite their resolve and their fancy armor, they aren't as well-trained as professional soldiers, but they're fast and often compensate for their lack of accuracy by using the Church's trademark weapon: flamethrowers!","STR_CHURCH_HANDMAID_UFOPEDIA":"The clergy would never tarnish their reputation by hiring servants off the street. The Shrine Maidens, while doing basically the same tasks, are well-paid and protected by their sacred status. They're skilled handmaids, performers and courtesans who, as the clergy says, can add a piece of celestial purity into even the dirtiest of mundane works.","STR_CHURCH_MAIDEN_UFOPEDIA":"The Church has an all-female order tasked with defense, called Maidens of War. Unlike Zealots, they're rarely used in offensive actions. Their origins are also different - unlike street urchins and assorted riffraff, the Maidens are recruited from the children of the Church's low level workers and Church-run orphanages. Maidens' training is centered on martial arts, but they seem to be pretty well educated in general. What we have caught is a low-level Maiden, and she seems to be more susceptible to our subtle coercion than many of the other, fanatical members of the Church.{NEWLINE}The armor Maidens wear is a customized version of a standard human Combat Armor, slightly more resistant to energy, but less to chem and piercing than normal, which seems to be a staple of all Church armors.","STR_CHURCH_ELITE_UFOPEDIA":"It is unbelievable that a human, even aided with a fancy refractor-equipped flying armor, can achieve such levels of physical performance. The Exalts not only can sustain enormous amounts of poison, exertion, pain or humiliation, they seem to actually enjoy it. These elite fighters also seem to be less block-headed than normal Zealots; they don't really revere the Star Gods at all. If anything, they narcissistically revere themselves. Seems that the inner circles of the Church are more into debauchery and self-indulgence than praying.","STR_BEASTMASTER_TERRORIST_UFOPEDIA":"Beastmasters are a special caste within The Church who tends to its critters. If you've seen those pets, you must have an idea on what their masters are like. They are smart, physically strong, daring and often a little wrong in the heads. Do not relax once you destroy their armor - the arcane circuitry on their underwear still dissipates laser energies very well and can even be used to deliver low-powered laser blasts. Better take them from behind, nay?","STR_CHURCH_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA":"The heavy armor of a Beastmaster shares the same base characteristics as Zealot's armor, although it is thicker, and provides full enviro protection (fire & gas) - Beastmasters are much more valuable and usually leave attacking to their pets, so mobility is not required. The defining (and expensive) feature of this armor is its ablativeness - if the damage is too great to withstand, it explodes outwards, revealing a pretty much unharmed and very pissed Beastmaster.","STR_CHURCH_MATRON_UFOPEDIA":"Matrons are universally revered and respected officials and leaders within the Maidens of War order of the Church. Their duties are to run Maiden covens, but also various non-military establishments of the Church, from food handout centres to hospitals. Sometimes they also serve as special envoys for the Church. They're skilled melee fighters, diplomats, lore-keepers and healers. In short, these older women are jaded, sophisticated and kind of creepy so we'd better keep them separated from the rest of our population, who knows what kind of curses and love-magics they possess?","STR_CHURCH_PRIEST_UFOPEDIA":"Priests are the Church's field operatives, often not very bright but always fanatical in their fervour and true to their belief. The Church naturally assumes that everyone worships Star Gods, which is sometimes a good thing, and sometimes a very bad thing. Be careful, them priests know how to brawl. They are usually former Zealots and might tell us about their trade as well.","STR_CHURCH_LEADER_UFOPEDIA":"Reverends are lower level spiritual leaders, who have the right to claim that they speak the will of the Star Gods. More refined and richer than ordinary Zealots, they are nevertheless as fanatical and can pose a significant threat. With plenty of foolhardy people and magical powers at their disposal, these make bad enemies. They also have nice refractors, but are otherwise rather easy to take down in close quarters combat. What's curious: they seem to be also interested in the ways of the Old Earth, which seems to be a contradiction to their Star Gods worship...","STR_CHURCH_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA":"These high leaders of The Church are powerful, clever and highly skilled in magics. Commanding entire armies of fanatical warriors, each one of these is worth a fortune, if we manage to capture them. Just look at these robes! Surprisingly however, these hedonistic individuals do not seem to take the Star God worship as seriously as one would expect - like the Star Gods were only convenient idols for them, and fully replaceable.","STR_MUTON_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA":"The Mercenaries are tenacious, lethal and very tough. They do not negotiate with their enemies, so don't expect to get much ransom for their warriors. Even these lower-ranking Mercs are not an enemy to be trifled with, as the companies always recruit new members from mutants with combat experience.","STR_MUTON_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA":"The Commandos are combat veterans of ill-renown, who wear the toughest muscle-suits, equipped with gravpacks for maximum mobility. Do not even think these guys are going to go down without a serious fight.","STR_MUTON_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA":"The so-called Engineers are a special caste within mercenary companies. Of course, they're fully capable engineers, tending to mercenary ships and weapons. However, in combat, they're far from being pushovers: their custom weapons, camo suits and combat sights make them extremely deadly marksmen. They're also able to see through stealth, spotting your camouflaged units from far away.","STR_MUTON_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA":"Some of the Mercs, who are too crazy or stupid to be trusted with ranged weapons, wear massive suits of Plastasteel armor and serve as living battering rams, armed with lethal plasma gloves that can destroy pretty much anything in a super-gory fashion. The best practical way of killing them, short of a tactical nuke, is a powerful laser blast to their comparatively thin back plate.","STR_MUTON_LEADER_UFOPEDIA":"The Mercenary Captains are the elite within an elite; they dedicate their whole lives to mastering all aspects of the art of warfare, from sword fighting through squad tactics to orbital bombardments. While engaging rank-and-file Mercenaries with melee weapons is a viable, if desperate tactic; against these guys, it is strongly unadvised. The Mercenary Captains are also ranking members of the so-called 'Space Rangers', thus linking these two forces together in the Stellar Empire's enforcers' hierarchy.","STR_MUTON_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA":"The toughest and strongest of all Mercenaries, veterans of countless battles and figures of considerable power. They fight with fluidity and speed backed by decades of practice and honed by combat drugs.","STR_GOVT_AGENT_UFOPEDIA":"Instead of relying on slaves to do general tasks, the Govts deploy these well-motivated individuals. Don't let their looks deceive you, these guys have quick reflexes, know how to use their guns and won't break down easily. They are also trained in martial arts, so don't be surprised if they dodge your melee attacks.","STR_GOVT_PILOT_UFOPEDIA":"Since being allowed to fly a nuclear-powered vessel is considered a major privilege in any Provincial Govt's organization, these guys consider themselves to be elite. Truth be told, despite their buffoonery, they're usually much better specialists than Guild Air Sailors. Watch out for their well-honed reflexes if you actually engage them in ground combat - which is a sure way to offend their masters and upset our politics, by the way.","STR_GOVT_MP_UFOPEDIA":"Military Police are pretty much the only kind of police most people will ever see. Armed with heavy weapons and riding armored vehicles, or even aircraft, these hard-like-rock men will usually shoot first, ask questions later. None the less, they're govt officers, even if much less valuable than Enforcers or Pilots, so getting in a shootout with them is a political decision.","STR_GOVT_ENFORCER_UFOPEDIA":"The government Enforcers are what the name implies - people who kill people whom the Provincial Govts deem necessary to be killed. They might lack the sheer survival instincts of the Marsec security men, but they're very well trained, are better shots and have stronger minds. They wear the same standard carapace armor as most security forces.","STR_GOVT_ELITE_UFOPEDIA":"These guys are the Govt's special forces, rigorously trained and highly loyal to their employers. They wear improved personal armor (equipped with simple active camouflage - CAMO: 15/5, and great ThV - 70%), are issued better weapons, and can boast high combat skills, almost on par with veteran Mercenaries.","STR_GOVT_SIREN_UFOPEDIA":"As the Govts started to seriously consider cooperating with Reticulans to create a common earth-dweller front, they wanted to co-opt Reticulan psionics too. However, they had no trust in Hybrids, and the Rets themselves were willing to share only Sirens and Sectogres. Since Sirens were smarter and sexier, while equally obedient, the govts chose them. The Govt Siren is psionically-boosted, which makes her a dangerous mind-controller, and military training ensures her standard combat skills are adequate as well. Their light armor is especially good against Piercing damage.","STR_GOVT_GENERAL_UFOPEDIA":"Highest-ranking Provincial Govt commanders are worth a royal ransom. Hopefully worth enough to compensate for the huge trouble we've brought on ourselves for attacking one of them.","STR_BANDIT_RATMAN_UFOPEDIA":"The Ratmen are a sub-race of mutant midgets, universally despised by everyone, in no small part for their disregard of private property. For that reason, they face a choice between embracing robbery or dying alone, which is a very simple choice indeed. They're weak and fragile, but do not underestimate their reflexes and shooting abilities.","STR_REAPER_CAVALRY_TERRORIST_UFOPEDIA":"???.","STR_BANDIT_RATMAN_HUNTER_UFOPEDIA":"These ratmen wander the outskirts of their 'villages' as well as more civilized settlements, hunting for prey, be it unwary travellers or wild animals, anything goes to feed their destitute communities. They're a bit better fighters than average Ratlings, especially with the bow and the knife. They're the most dangerous when met at night, when they can take advantage of their innate night vision (all Ratlings have a NV of 16), while they themselves are hard to spot (CAMO: 4).","STR_BANDIT_RATMAN_LEADER_UFOPEDIA":"These Ratmen are even more skilled rogues than usual, always quick to use their knives, but that's not what makes them really dangerous. They are high-ranking enforcers and racket collectors, working for the bosses of the Ratling Mafia, and killing them might cause reprisals - the Mafia is known for its vengefulness and territoriality.","STR_BANDIT_BOY_UFOPEDIA":"Gangs that operate in cities always need a fresh stock of footsoldiers, and these young guys fit the bill perfectly - some crack, booze and hoes keep their loyalty, while losing one is not a biggie. They're quite ruthless, but relatively easy to scare or impress. Their combat abilities aren't completely mediocre, and they possess some skill at dodging fist and knife attacks.","STR_BANDIT_HIGHWAYMAN_UFOPEDIA":"The Highwaymen are seasoned and well-trained plunderers, who also often work as bodyguards, bounty hunters or lawmen. They're romanticized in popular culture, but not liked by the federal govts. They prefer to use ranged weapons, and possess better training with those than most Bandits, but they're far from harmless in melee. Their leather armors allow them to dodge sloppy blows, as well as provide some protection against most forms of attack, like daze, fire, chem, smoke and cutting - at the price of movement speed.","STR_BANDIT_DRIFTER_UFOPEDIA":"Drifters are nondescript individuals in a perpetual transitory state, often travelling from town to another town in search for who knows what. Dextrous with gun and knife, they don't turn down dirty work. Their nomadic and loner nature often leads them to developing strong spirituality, or, as others call it, going cuckoo. It's not a rare occurrence when a Drifter joins some crazy cult or develops taste for sentient flesh; on the other hand, some stabilize enough to join city militias.","STR_BANDIT_DUDE_UFOPEDIA":"Rank and file bandits, often employed by various mobs as soldiers. Some others work as bouncers, yet others as slavers. They're most abundant in cities. Unlike poorer bandits, they wear some cheap armor, which gives them slight resistance to Piercing, Cutting and Chem damage - shotgun pellets, small bore bullets and knives are all part of their daily life. They have no special skills or weaknesses, except for being, on average, not very sharp.","STR_BANDIT_FUSSBALLER_UFOPEDIA":"These strapping young lads are known for their boldness, hence, probably, the term. They are adventuring types, working for town gangs or forming gangs on their own. In these endeavours, they are of the mind that poor guns cannot defeat skillful tackles and headbutts. As such, they're equipped with close combat gear and called upon when a vicious mugging is in order. Many dream of becoming Gravball celebrities.","STR_BANDIT_HITMAN_UFOPEDIA":"A specialist in dirty work. Tougher and more tenacious than he looks. Skilled at spotting camouflaged units. Watch out for his high reflexes and accuracy.","STR_BANDIT_TOMB_RUNNER_UFOPEDIA":"There are many old ruins in the world, underground or otherwise, and these valued specialists are professional looters. In this line of work, requiring climbing, rappelling and running from monsters, armor is usually a hindrance, but Runners wear some protection against melee and chem. They're also in top physical form and trained in stealth and defense against dark magics. Their fancy and expensive equipment grants them NV of 12. Our sponsors consider Tomb Runners to be pests and won't be upset if we dispose of them, just like of any other bandits.","STR_BANDIT_GHOUL_UFOPEDIA":"These despicable creatures suffer from the horrible Necron disease. The full enviro suits they wear protect both themselves from their surroundings, and vice versa. They sometimes conduct 'harvest' raids to replace their failing organs with fresh ones, taken from their victims. They live in small communities, known for their medical and chemical knowledge. The disease they suffer from, apart from disfiguration, decay and horrible smell, also gives them some unique feats - like the ability to regenerate lost health during battle, at the cost of a major strain to their bodies. They're immune to chem and smoke, and resistant to daze, laser and concussion. Their sole weakness is Burn damage, but when they stop burning, they just regenerate back. They see through smoke quite well (ThV: 50%). Better to kill them fast to avoid trouble.","STR_BANDIT_GHOUL_SCI_UFOPEDIA":"The 'Scientists' are the leaders and shamans of the Ghoul communities, very skilled in medicine, genetics and even more mundane engineering. Feeling nothing but envy and contempt for all 'Smoothies', as the Necron-inflicted call us, they indulge in the most abhorrent experiments. They're also faster, more perceptive and tougher than their rank-and-file Ghoul brethren.","STR_BLOOD_DOG_UFOPEDIA":"These vicious, mutated animals are often employed by Bandits for combat. It is unclear how the Bandits are able to tame such creatures, but judging by how these small monsters look, maybe it's just a case of misery loving company. The Hounds are adept at surviving on the wastelands and are somewhat resistant to all forms of damage; piercing and concussive weapons seem to work best against them, while smoke, daze and fire are the least effective. The huge, thick skull of the creature serves both as a support for its powerful jaws and as natural armor, so better engage them from the sides or behind.","STR_DOGG_UFOPEDIA":"A small beast of Earth origin, used in hunting, warfare and agriculture since ancient times. Despite all kinds of alien and mutated creatures available for the task, the Dogs are still tamed and bred by humans and mutants alike, for their fierce loyalty and ease of training. (Animal Lover Award: 200 points granted)","STR_GIANT_BEETLE_UFOPEDIA":"These large, mutated insects have proven to be indestructible as a species, and only got better over the last few centuries. Very hard to kill unless with fire or poisonous gas. Omnivorous, they attack with mandibles coated with saliva that dissolves most forms of matter (Chem damage, damages armor). NV: 10. ThV: 40%","STR_MEGASCORPION_UFOPEDIA":"These beasties employ a large sting to poison their victims (Chem, halves armor). Said stings are very sought after for their supposed benefits to male sexual prowess; after being ground, the stings are either consumed or applied directly to the body part in question. The creature itself has armor that can sometimes deflect Piercing and Laser attacks due to being well-angled. SENSE: 15 (tremors).","STR_MEGASCORPION_POISON_UFOPEDIA":"This fluid can only be extracted from a freshly-killed creature, as it rapidly deteriorates when in contact with fresh air. It can be sold for some good coin or kept for later in a tightly-closed flask. The poison is quite dangerous as it not only causes Health loss, but also rapidly drains Energy.","STR_GIANTSPIDER_UFOPEDIA":"Giant spiders are fast, tenacious and very poisonous (Chem damage). SENSE: 15 (tremors).","STR_CHUPACABRA_UFOPEDIA":"Very fast, very aggressive and equipped with very sharp teeth (Melee damage). ThV: 50%","STR_VAMPIRE_BAT_UFOPEDIA":"A mythical beast that moves fast and stealthily. It is almost impossible to evade its senses or react in time once it swoops down. Its only weaknesses are a fragile frame and poor day sight. Its bite isn't instantly lethal, but drains a lot of Energy and Stun, as well as regenerates creature's health (Melee damage). NV/DV: 25. ThV: 100%. SPOT: 15. CAMO: 0/7","STR_RYBA_UFOPEDIA":"These fish can bite you if you come too close, but overall they're not too dangerous (Melee damage). SENSE: 15 (water).","STR_KRAB_UFOPEDIA":"This species of crab is very territorial and infamous for cutting bikini strings. We theorize it is instinct to remove the shell of its prey before starting to eat; while not very powerful, its attacks will incur serious armor damage (Melee damage). SENSE: 15 (tremors).","STR_RAIDER_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA":"The Scouts are at the bottom of the Raider's food chain, and always end up with the worst guns. Still, despite their crappy gear, they're Ubers like us, which makes them fast and tough.","STR_RAIDER_THUG_UFOPEDIA":"In the Raider's world, might makes right, and so the Thugs are above the Scouts through the sheer physical might they possess, hence they end up with better guns. However, they're not as fast. Generally, they're just Very Tough Guys, nothing more.","STR_RAIDER_BUZZARD_UFOPEDIA":"Buzzards are rich enough to get their hands on grav-packs and other high-tech gear, including combat drugs they indulge in without any restraint. Whatever can be said about their sanity (which is not much), the drugs make them quick and deadly.","STR_RAIDER_BOSS_UFOPEDIA":"The strongest, toughest and smartest (the latter being an easy feat) Raiders become Bosses of their gangs. Their trademark spikey breastplates aren't actually that good at stopping bullets, while considerably slowing the wearers down, but Bosses shouldn't be underestimated, as they have access to the best weapons a gang possesses. This gives them knowledge about guns, and I think they'd be willing to share if asked nicely.","STR_RAIDER_HUMONGOUS_UFOPEDIA":"Sometimes Raider parties contain these brutes, who are even harder to put down than ordinary Raiders. They have the physical capacity to lead their own gangs, but rarely have the smarts required (most, indeed, have the mental faculties of an average monkey); and those few who do, usually proceed to join the Mercenaries.","STR_RAIDER_FIREBAT_UFOPEDIA":"Large gangs of Raiders are sometimes led by these pyromaniacs, clad in scavenged suits of powered armor. Take note that while the armor isn't of the very best quality, it contains a veteran Uber leader. Compared to human powered armor, it is slightly more resilient to fire, plasma, piercing and cutting damage. It does lack equally good sights, though.","STR_SPARTAN_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA":"It is very hard for a female to be accepted into the ranks of the Spartan warriors, but the alternative - being a virtual property of a Spartan fort - is so unappealing that many of them try anyway. They rarely advance past the lowest rank, but they're forced to constantly prove they are better than their male peers, so they cannot be underestimated. They can be interrogated for their knowledge of various light firearms.","STR_SPARTAN_RIFLEMAN_UFOPEDIA":"Riflemen are the rank-and-file Spartans, but that doesn't mean they aren't pretty dangerous (and bad-mouthed). Still, they can be convinced to tell us what they know about firearms.","STR_SPARTAN_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA":"As in the Spartan world, having a big gun is synonymous with having a big... uhm, respect, these guys are well-respected (even though we found no solid evidence in that area that could be a basis for respecting this group more than an average group of pureblood males - possibly more research would be in order). They are strong enough to easily carry heavy weapons, and can tell us about those.","STR_SPARTAN_CAPTAIN_UFOPEDIA":"Spartan warbands are led by these low-ranking officers, whose words are to be followed without question. They wear improved Spartan armor, so don't be surprised if they don't go down easily. They're always combat veterans, so their fighting skills are great, but their knowledge can be used to our advantage if we manage to capture more of them. Their cheap night shades give them NV of 12.","STR_HUMAN_SOLDIER_COMMANDO_UFOPEDIA":"An elite human soldier, found in better-equipped military forces and very rich raiding gangs. Wears a full, bulletproof, chameleonic body suit laced with sophisticated electronics. Watch out for his deadly accuracy. Can be questioned for his broad knowledge of weaponry. Trivia: Human Commandos find the vague term 'Purebloods' as insulting, and identify themselves with the 'humans of old', which seems to be some sort of a loose but large organization (or a network of loosely affiliated organizations), lurking in the shadows. Hence, we can ransom these guys for good coin.","STR_HUMAN_NOMAD_UFOPEDIA":"These tribesmen embrace strict religion and shun the modern, civilized society and technology. Their tribe is said to be constantly raided by various bandits, who kidnap their women; so the men must constantly sell themselves as hunters and caravan guards to make dough to buy them back. Funny story, that is, but makes sense: nobody likes the lofty Nomads for how they're hell-bent on aggressively ignoring the world outside of their tribe. Combat-wise, they employ camouflaged suits of thick Durathread and are generally far better equipped that one would think.","STR_MEGAPOL_UFOPEDIA":"Status: GLOBAL POLICE{NEWLINE}Megapol is a global police organization, privately-owned and strongly tied to the Guild. They're authorized to hunt crime all over the planet. The local govts aren't too happy with this, but they have little choice, considering limitations in global travel and the considerable cost of keeping their own, loyal police forces in full capacity. Megapol often helps Govts (or competes with them) to fight all kinds of crime, but its sword is aimed first and foremost against the Black Market. Govts don't love the Black Market, but consider it a necessary evil as it allows them to distribute goods outside the Solar Governor's knowledge and Guild's tariffs. Megapol naturally works for the Guild, Academy and Church as well.","STR_MEGAPOL_WOLFMAN_UFOPEDIA":"Megapol readily employs Beastmen for policing duties, as the work doesn't require high intelligence and Beastmen are cheap and very receptive to orders. Wolfmen have naturally keen senses, giving them not only NV 12 but also an ability to smell camouflaged units. Their long-range vision at day isn't as keen, though. They're clad in shiny armor that protects quite well against most threats, but is vulnerable to Chem. Their stamina allows them to move quite fast in this armor, but their combat skills, and especially willpower, are as terrible as one would expect of a Beastman. SPOT: 3 (smell)","STR_MEGAPOL_ENFORCER_UFOPEDIA":"Pigmen are not only burly, but also quite smart for Beastmen. They're employed as either herders of Wolfmen, or as shock troopers in their own assault units. Swines nowadays can also, apparently, fly; their synthmuscle-powered armor is equipped with a grav engine, and to make matters worse, is also stupidly durable, especially against Piercing damage. The grav units they use, however, are of a cheap variety and suffer from critical weakness to Chem. Enforcers move slowly and have poor NV (9), but are able to sniff through camouflage (SPOT: 4).","STR_MEGAPOL_DETECTIVE_UFOPEDIA":"Highly paid and extremely skilled operatives, employed by Megapol to lead manhunts. Sometimes they command whole hordes of Beastmen, but more often they work alone. These guys are often augmented and almost always are heavy drug users, which boosts their already high abilities to uncanny levels. Their armor is a custom human Carapace, not much tougher than normal, but without weakness to Chem. NV: 17, ThV: 30%. CAMO: 10/3.","STR_MEGAPOL_APEMAN_UFOPEDIA":"These powerful beastmen resemble a cross between human and gorilla. They have similar body plan and physical abilities to Brute mutants, but aren't simply just weak to magic and manipulation - they're critically vulnerable to it. They're also nowhere as skilled with firearms. Megapol makes use of their sheer strength, loyalty and bravery to break up mass gatherings, and their prodigious running skills to tackle suspects. Apemen enjoy some NV (12) but also can see pretty well though smoke (Thermal Vision 50%). They wear Synthmuscle armor that is very resistant to Piercing.","STR_ETHEREAL_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA":"This creature, doing tricks with levitation and telekinesis and protected by a strong forcefield turned out to be not really a god, just a muscle-man made in their image. More of a bio-machine than an actual person. Still possesses the SENSE (8)","STR_ETHEREAL_NOVICE_UFOPEDIA":"We tried to interrogate that hooded weirdo we've captured, and I'm telling you, it was hard! He almost made the brainers kill one another! And it turns out we succeeded only because we caught one of their youngest, a novice in their order, who eventually succumbed to our diplomatic wiles. But even such a novice commands deadly magics and that's why the Star Gods never use any real weapons. Another lesson is, unless we devise a powerful VooDoo of our own, it's better not to try interrogating more powerful captives.","STR_ETHEREAL_LEADER_UFOPEDIA":"We have finally captured a proper Star God. Turns out their role in the Stellar Empire is that of high-profile messengers and executors, with an absolute authority over all lesser races but subservient to some supreme will; I guess that makes them more like angels than proper gods, but they're really full of themselves anyway. Also it turns out there are several types of Star Gods; the ones we meet are 'Guides', but there are ones called 'Subduers' as well, who don't have that cool glow effect, cannot turn invisible, and are unable to use Ghost Beams, relying on telekinesis and plasma guns instead. The latter type, however, appears mostly during planetary conquests.","STR_ETHEREAL_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA":"While we suspected the highest-ranking and most powerful Star Gods to be in charge in the Empire, this is not the case. This member of their elite said they're more of an inquisition-like institution, charged with overseeing the empire but never making political decisions; this task belongs to, strange as it may seem, some sort of disembodied super-brains - the true rulers, and usually very autonomous at that (the Star Gods seem to adore them in an almost sexual way). Anyway, the Commander gave us a crucial piece of code required to get to our local super-brain, ruling the Solar System from Mars...","STR_MUTANTS_UFOPEDIA":"Status: DOWNTRODDEN MAJORITY{NEWLINE}Earth is inhabited by millions upon millions of mutants, belonging to a bewildering array of strains, tribes and nations. They come in all shapes and sizes, and live everywhere, from forgotten villages to bustling towns; only the strict centres of big cities are forbidden to most of them. While some mutants are downright bizarre, many are indistinguishable from a pureblood human even in a minute examination; most are somewhere in between. One thing is common amongst them: they're treated like dirt by the high and mighty of this world, and are our potential allies. After all, we're mutants too.","STR_MALE_CIVILIAN_UFOPEDIA":"These are mutants who were influenced by the Uber strain, but in a small enough degree that they can easily survive outside of Zones. They share some Uber characteristics, like tough skin, night vision or strength, but in a less developed form. On the other hand, their resistance to magic is infamously bad, not much better than Beastmen's, which makes them easily swayed by figures of authority. To better resist such influences, many of them adhere to a strange religion, called Monotheism.","STR_FEMALE_CIVILIAN_UFOPEDIA":"Almost indistinguishable from a human, except for things like strange hair or eye pigmentation or other minor features. They can possess quite unusual agility and magic aptitude, but such individuals quickly rise above the mundane toils of mutant communities, becoming entertainers, clairvoyants or thieves, which brings their whole kind a reputation of being sneaky and untrustworthy.","STR_CIVILIAN_MUT_3_UFOPEDIA":"Reticulan hybrids who live in normal mutant communities have little in common with their Reticulan ancestors, except for being smart and somewhat immoral. These two qualities make them often rise in social hierarchy, but only to a point; no sane mutant community would choose one to be their leader, and the purebloods loathe them for their alien-ness. Even the Xeno-friendly Church of Sirius offers no refuge to them, as, for unknown reasons, the Church sees the whole Reticulan race as some sort of space traitors. Like all Reticulan strains, they have great nightvision and are hardly impeded by smoke.","STR_CIVILIAN_MUT_4_UFOPEDIA":"Dumb, strong and bad-tempered, these savages are tolerated by other mutants only because they can be convinced to participate in the hardest manual labour; Lamias have little material needs, but most of them prefer working over hunting to fill their ever-hungry bellies. They're also very resistant to heat and toxin, which is an added advantage, inherited from Snakemen. Lamias have a vicious bite, and some of them can even spit acid.","STR_CIVILIAN_MUT_5_UFOPEDIA":"Most Brutes, despite being hulking monsters, are quite docile, which makes them popular in any mutant community; they're valued as workers, farmers, and even artisans and leaders. Anything that doesn't require too much science, as they're not gifted in that area, to say the least. Like all Brutes, they're very tough and especially resistant to Daze and Piercing damage.","STR_HUMANS_UFOPEDIA":"Status: PRIVILEGED MINORITY{NEWLINE}The humans claim they used to rule the Earth. To distinguish themselves from us mutants - most of us look 'humanlike' after all - they call themselves 'Purebloods'. Generally if you can pass for a human, own enough 'legal' property, abide to the law and live in an 'official' settlement, you're a Pureblood. If you're poor or illegal, you're not, even if you look perfectly like a human of old. Humans are aloof, but those who are just simple citizens aren't strictly evil - the just thing to do is to rob and otherwise molest them, mass-murder is not only morally questionable but might lead to decreases in our Protection Payments.","STR_HUMAN_MALE_3_UFOPEDIA":"These bad-mouthed boys will often think that since they own a gun, they're untouchable. Smacking them over their heads, or killing a few others to make an example should destroy that illusion.","STR_HUMAN_FEMALE_4_UFOPEDIA":"Sturdy clothing and self-confidence mark a woman who's seen her share, knows how to defend herself and usually carries a weapon.","STR_HUMAN_CITY_GIRL_UFOPEDIA":"These often-not-quite-Purebloods live by all sorts of knavery, from relatively benign information gathering to outright theft. They have quick feet and quick wits, required to survive on the fringes of the Pureblood society. When engaged in melee, they can sometimes dodge blows that'd otherwise hit.","STR_HUMAN_HOE_UFOPEDIA":"Although reduced to selling their bodies on the streets, these girls aren't sheep and most of them will jump at the first opportunity to change their life. Don't expect them to stand idle as you rob them, either, even though their combat skills are pitiful.","STR_HUMAN_SHARP_GUY_UFOPEDIA":"These dudes in fancy suits are pretty rich and can be ransomed for some good dolaro. They're not affiliated with any Faction though so killing them won't really work towards our 'protection' scheme.","STR_HUMAN_MASTER_UFOPEDIA":"The Mages are amongst the top tier of the Pureblood society, although they prefer to be called 'humans of old' or simply 'men'. The Mages are members of old and powerful families and they wield strong VooDoo, devastating against Beastmen and dangerous even to humans and mutants. Their money, allies and influence are a good safeguard against any prosecution they might face from the Academy. They're quite high and mighty because of their status and can be sold for quite a ransom. Mages don't wear any armor, but their spells make them resistant to Plasma-type damage and allow them to regenerate Health in battle. The Mages, like the Commandos and Reverends are the paragons of the human race: the empire builders.","STR_HUMAN_NOBLEWOMAN_UFOPEDIA":"These members of pureblood high society can be ransomed to their worried families for a sizeable bag of cash. Don't understimate them, though, as they are fairly well trained to fend off any would-be molesters (and this includes VooDoo training).","STR_HUMAN_FATMAN_UFOPEDIA":"These rich guys are slow and very easy to catch. They should lose some weight since it's not even fun. The only 'weapons' they normally carry are booze and cash.","STR_EXPERIMENT_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA":"The mutants freed from the clutches of these ugly Academy wenches, are, naturally, quite willing to show us appreciation for their freedom. For that reason, I think it would be good to keep them around for a while. Not like we can do much else with them, anyway, right, Cap'n?","STR_DAMSEL_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA":"Young females, kidnapped by various brutes for their beauty (as in, physical health and the right amount of tender meat), either for slavery, consumption or organ harvesting. We get a lot of good press for freeing them, and we can either ransom them back to their home communities for some nice coin (however at a discount), or introduce them to our big and growing family here.","STR_BUGEYE_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA":"I have little idea why someone would want to go into trouble of capturing and enslaving Bugeyes. They're almost useless as workforce and too smart for their own good. The Bugeyes themselves say that they were used as guinea pigs for drug related experiments, but who'd believe them? Maybe the Mutant Alliance will be interested in accepting these good-for-nothings.","STR_RAYNERD_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA":"These are Mutant Alliance's special operatives. They're creepily handsome and in possession of weird mutant powers. Something tells me that it's better to get rid of them as soon as possible. We can either sell them out or return them to the Alliance for a hefty price.","STR_SISTER_VICTIM_UFOPEDIA":"Some of our sisters who shared our misery at Academy experimental camp have either stayed behind, or gone missing during our escape. It also stands to reason that like-minded souls have fallen on bad times elsewhere in this cruel world. Such people can be rescued and invited into our ranks ('Recruit' under Workshop's 'Interrogation' category; after the project is completed, she'll take 24 further hours to orient and recuperate). Or used otherwise - like I said, it's a cruel world.","STR_HUMAN_LABOURER_UFOPEDIA":"These hardy folks toil endlessly, and hopelessly, in mines, factories, power plants and other industries - in those countries that have any industry, naturally. Upon their backs, the entire might of their local governments (and perhaps, even the Stellar Empire) is built, yet they get very little in return. Thankfully our job is a hell of a lot better.","STR_BEASTMEN_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Status: CLUELESS MASSES{NEWLINE}While the upper classes are comprised of Purebloods, and slums and villages occupied by Mutants, Beastmen make the rest of Earth's population. Beastmen are distinct from the other two groups by three factors; first, they're a mix of human and animal genes (as opposed to mutants, who were artificially engineered using alien DNA); second, they could never pass for humans; third, while often cunning - intelligent even, they are prone to emotional outbursts and generally lack the spiritualism and critical thought of the other two groups, making any intellectual growth impossible. Most of them, like Cowmen and Sheepmen, are rather docile, but even those who aren't - be it highly successful middle-class Wolfmen, or primitive savages living in the woods, while dangerous, are easily scared, distracted or manipulated, which makes them sort of perfect citizens, according to the ruling class.","STR_WEREWOLF_WARRIOR_UFOPEDIA":"The Werewolves are amongst the most feared of the wild Beastmen. They charge right at you, eager to feast on your entrails. Their legs are fast and their senses are keen, allowing to see in darkness, smoke and through camouflage. They're also known for their limited ability to regenerate health in battle","WEREWOLF_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA":"The hide of a Werewolf is considerably tough, but weak to fire and associated damage types. NV: 20; ThV: 50%; SPOT: 5. CAMO: 10/4","STR_SECURITY_AUTOPSY":"Aqua Plastics","STR_SECURITY_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"Almost as hard as diamond, while not much heavier than water and not much more brittle than iron, this material is grown in biochem factories. The main component of commonly worn Security and Carapace armor, usually mixed with other materials to form composite plating; varieties of such plating are too many to count, each with slightly different attributes. We can extract Aqua Plastics from damaged armor to fashion tools or armor of our own.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 4,000","STR_SECURITY_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA":"A class of expensive human armor, mass produced by Marsec and used by several major players. It is constructed from Aqua Plastics, thin impact plates over a skin-tight suit. This arrangement is both light and resistant to firearms, but has weakness to Laser and Chem damage. Sometimes a Durathread overcoat is worn over it to alleviate these problems. Extras include an air filter (upgradeable to a full life support) and nocto/thermal vision of at least decent quality.","STR_HUMAN_POWER_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA":"Some considerably well-off humans wear these Marsec-produced, imposing and expensive suits of armor, composed of Plastasteel plates, backed by powerful, yet cumbersome, servos. The bulky appearance might be misleading, as the armor is actually quite thin, just angled to deflect attacks and to leave a lot of internal space for machinery and personal gear. This arrangement causes some melee attacks to just bounce off (flat 20% Evasion), but leaves the armor slightly vulnerable to Chem damage. The suit is fully sealed and can be used in space; it is also equipped with very good NV/ThV. We could perhaps repair recovered suits, but this would require a better understanding of how the power source and other mechanisms work.","STR_MEGASCORPION_STING_UFOPEDIA":"Believed to increase sexual potency; other than that, useless.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 10k","STR_SPIDER_SILK_UFOPEDIA":"A beautiful thread produced by these beautiful creatures. Stronger than steel, but easily cut and quick to decay. Can be useful for bows.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 2,000","STR_MONSTER_TEETH_UFOPEDIA":"Some very sharp fangs.

They are charged with exploring the ever-shifting wasteland that is Earth and researching new forms of mutated life. In practice, they scout mutant communities and indirectly help to efficiently police them. They particularly covet sorcerous powers and unquestionably are their most famous practitioners, after the Star Gods themselves. Most of them use standard human equipment and can be easily looted, but the Academy is perfectly able to put its vast resources to work and deploy high-tech guns and robotic weapons.","STR_OSIRON_UFOPEDIA":"Status: ACADEMY SUB-FACTION{NEWLINE}Osiron is an important department within the Academy, responsible for security, industry and menial labor. It is theoretically autonomous from the Academy proper, but in fact they stick together like two halves of one thing. The security guards we combat when dealing with the Academy are Osiron men, as well as many other members who perform tasks that Academy sorceresses find unworthy of their attention. Because these two organizations work so closely together, Osiron teams are often accompanied by Academy Espers who provide all sorts of psionic aid. Osiron is basically the place where all the Academy's males can be found.","STR_ACADEMY_RECRUITMENT":"Academy Recruitment","STR_ACADEMY_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA":"The quest to become one of the Academy begins at a very early age. Children attend all-female boarding schools, most of which are located in the countryside and co-financed by the Academy. After a very strict selective process that continues till the age of 18, only the smartest students are allowed to compete for enrollment into one of Academy's universities - Technical and Medical Academies. Graduates of the former become Researchers, the latter - Nurses. The most prestigeous are Astro Academies, which deal primarly with arcanist students and post-graduate Explorers. The numerous dropouts don't have it easy - some succeed with the Guild, the Church or local administration, but many are forced to take jobs as maids, waitresses or outright prostitutes.","STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY":"Integrated Devices","STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"We took time to carefully poke around the looted belongings of an Academician and found a bunch of smart tools used in their trade. Additional inquiry into this topic could perhaps allow us to devise something useful.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 1,250","STR_GUILD_UFOPEDIA":"Status: GLOBAL POWER{NEWLINE}The Traders, unlike the population at large, are allowed to freely travel around the Earth and barter their goods. They are crucial for the Star Gods overseers to maintain control over the planet, keeping the smaller local govts from attaining too much economic autonomy. The Traders have access to Stellar Empire technology and possess great wealth in ships and other goods. They are the prime target of our operations.","STR_MARSEC_UFOPEDIA":"Status: GUILD SUB-FACTION{NEWLINE}Marsec is the military arm of the Guild. The name comes from Mars, where its HQ resides. The Guild evolved from a global effort to colonize Mars under the Star Gods' blessings.

The weapon doesn't seem to be salvageable except for its parts, we have however found out its power rating (75) and that, while extremely deadly at close range, it should be much less accurate at extreme ranges. The droid is not only tough, but also boasts high accuracy and quick reactions.","TECHNOCRACY_ARMOR_P0_UFOPEDIA":"The plastasteel shell of this droid makes it resistant to most forms of damage, most notably Piercing.

They're Smuggler's bodyguards, amongst other things. Do not think they're harmless just because they look fragile. Engaging in melee unadvised unless wearing scratching-proof armor.

Luckily, your quick thinking, Cap'n, allowed us to take him alive. Surprisingly, he turned out to be a quite nice fellow, if really pissed at the fate of the Smuggler crew. Turns out that not every Star God supports the Stellar Empire and the guy is some sort of a rebel, preaching how they betrayed the idea of balance and how we're a savage product of a barbaric system. With that, he uttered one insult too many, but we learned something about the Star God hierarchy none the less. If we capture more guys like this one, we can sell them to Mercenaries, as the Star Gods put enormous bounties on such rebel's heads.","STR_NEKOMIMI_UFOPEDIA":"Status: INDEPENDENT EMPIRE{NEWLINE}The Nekomimi civilization somehow managed to flourish and achieve space travel without any interference by the Star Gods. Cunning and aggressive, they're still no real threat to the vastness of the Stellar Empire, but the Star Gods likewise are refraining from engaging in a direct military action, perhaps due to the rumored gigaton-sized warships the Nekomimi command. Being a much more primitive civilization than the ancient Star Gods, the Nekomimi still managed to come up with several unique technologies, and there might be a way to acquire some of these.","STR_ANIMATRONS_UFOPEDIA":"Status: INTERSTELLAR NUISANCE{NEWLINE}Animatrons are sneaky A.I.s from space. They constantly travel the galaxy, trading, foraging and sometimes hunting. The Empire considers them a nuisance, but their homeland is a part of it, therefore they are tolerated. Animatrons can integrate with any machine equipped with Optical Processors, but they prefer humanoid forms. They are powered by a hellerium-derivative, called Alenium. A diverse bunch, some Animatrons promote peace and love in the galaxy, some are more interested in exterminating all protein-based life forms, so we better not trust them. If we happen to run into them and scrap a few, nobody would care.","STR_THE_SILENCE_UFOPEDIA":"Status: INTERSTELLAR NUISANCE{NEWLINE}There are little hard facts known about this menace, which brings the silence of death to whole townships and space vessels. It is not even known where they came from and how many ships they have. They first appeared a few tens of thousands of years ago, shrouded in powerful cloaking, ridiculously hard to destroy, and armed with antiquated weapons. Every attempt at communication since has failed. Their motives are equally unknown - they just exterminate every sentient being and destroy all computers, then disappear, without even looting much. The only sure defense - don't let them hear you.","STR_MAGICAL_GIRL_UFOPEDIA":"These barely-adult girls have exactly that kind of immoral innocence about them that makes most males weak-kneed. They're also aggressively nice, playful and adaptive (see how she dresses after a few days here). What's perplexing though, they have no recollection of their identity or origin, or even the Well-wisher (whom they call the Goddess of Love, or of Cake), other than they found themselves aboard the ship with a deeply engraved mission of 'spreading love'. They also possess bits and pieces of strange knowledge and/or previous encounters.","STR_MAGICAL_GIRL_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA":"This gem is where the actual soul of a 'magical girl' resides. 'Killing' her physical body has no actual effect of killing the girl herself; the body is just a surrogate that can be re-produced by this gem, given enough time, biological matter and ambient energy (Hellerium works perfectly well, although electric current and sunlight will also do, only orders of magnitude slower); this works in a similar fashion as the fabled Regeneration Chambers. It is possible to influence this process (and the kind of body produced) by providing certain substances to the gem - we'll need the understanding of Genetics and Surgery Units to do that.

They're distant relatives to Reticulans, but while equally smart and magically gifted, are much less lazy and more vicious. They wield strange technologies of T'Leth, like the dreaded Sonic weaponry, and don't give a damn about either human or Star God laws.

They're also apparently at least equally nasty.","STR_DEEP_ONE_NOMAD_UFOPEDIA":"Deep One nomadic tribes can be found under the surface of the sea, hunting fish or drifting until they're summoned by their gods to war or menial labour - usually through their shamans, who commune with much more intelligent Aquatoids.  While these Deep Ones aren't as battle-hardened as those who can be found on land, the aquatic environment gives them an edge in combat, especially in dodging and dishing out melee attacks.","STR_DEEP_ONE_CHANTS_UFOPEDIA":"Cross-referencing the eerie chants sung by the Deep Ones with the writings of the Church brings striking realizations. Not only are the Elder Gods worshipped by both the same beings, but also the Deep One language seems to be related to the secret language Church honchos are using. One phrase recurs - 'the Old Gods will return'.","DEEP_ONE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA":"The aquatic nature of the Deep Ones makes them especially resilient to blast waves and blunt weapons. Engaging them in melee is also unadvised for inexperienced warriors: the beasties are not only tough, but also quicker than they seem. NV: 20.","LOBSTERMAN_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA":"Trying to kill this lumbering monstrosity is a pure nightmare. Deep Ones use them as six-limbed tanks that can shrug off most handheld weapons.

However the Stellar Empire still uses Reticulans on many worlds, and some are seen on Earth as the Star Gods' honor guard. These 'other Sectoids' are smart, well-equipped and think nothing of their 'earthly' brethren. All Reticulans have natural Heat Vision of 80%.","STR_RET_PEON_UFOPEDIA":"These little guys are common members of the Reticulan society, usually seen doing agricultural work or visiting tradeposts. They represent the archetypical traits of a Reticulan - lazy and dirty (in many ways), but at the same time curious, optimistic and adaptative. They wear conic hats and goggles, since they're very sensitive to sunlight (which also means they see really well in the dark), and show disregard for any other clothing, so typical for their race. They're weak, but quite smart. They closely resemble the original Reticulans, with their atrophied reproductive and digestive systems, and complete immunity to gas weapons, but aren't considered pure by the higher castes, who are obsessed with creation of a super-Reticulan of sorts.","STR_RET_HYBRID_UFOPEDIA":"Hybrids are a broad category of the various half-humans, half-reticulans who have been constantly created for hundreds of years by the Reticulan society. Thanks to their ancestry, they're really bright and make even better mages than the Reticulans themselves, but since they don't resemble the perfect Ret much, their talents are stifled and they're mostly used for menial work. No wonder many of them flee to settle down in mutant towns or join bandits, and many of them can reproduce with humans, which makes us more Hybrids.","STR_RET_SIREN_UFOPEDIA":"The animalistic, clawed Sirens are dangerous combatants, combining an agile body with Reticulan reflexes. Still, they're sort-of failed experiments in the Reticulan drive to create a Reticulan-compatible female who would free their race from the reliance on ancient cloning machines. It seems that the Reticulans succeeded with the task - to a degree. The human-reticulan hybrids who are actually able to reproduce (as well as other female slaves, who can always serve as natural replacement for artificial wombs), are well-guarded and cared for. The Sirens, despite their looks, aren't capable of reproduction but are well-suited for collecting 'gene samples' from all over the place, and thus can be interrogated for their knowledge of far-off lands.","STR_RET_SECTOGRE_UFOPEDIA":"The Reticulans, in their obsessive quest for achieving natural reproduction and nutrition, experimented with human and other mammal genes. Their first successful experiments went a bit overboard, creating these hulking brutes. They're quite bright as such, but most of them are incapable of reproducing, despite their openly displayed, impressive equipment. These unfortunates are used for heavy labour and security. On the other hand, a few Sectogres supposedly can mate even with other races, producing various hybrids as offspring. The Sectogres are quite popular with ladies and are thus a valuable source of info about them.","STR_RET_COMMANDO_UFOPEDIA":"These are ranking Reticulans, selected by the highest caste of their society - the so-called Progenitors - to order around Peons, Sirens, Sectogres and Hybrids. In a way, they're hybrids themselves - quite often biologically equipped for sex and/or eating normal food, but even if not, they're the smartest of the aforementioned bunch and trusted with some technological secrets. They wear camouflaged coats (CAMO: 10/3), somewhat resistant to energy weapons, and are deadly shots with the quirky Reticulan weapons.","STR_RET_ELDER_UFOPEDIA":"For a sexless alien, this old chap turned out to be quite a jolly joker - and a pervert to boot, I tell ya. If he's to believed, he's been alive for almost 200 years now, and he's just the last of a long line of clones, thousands of years old. According to him, the Star Gods would've fallen long ago if not for the unwilling help of the Reticulan race, who are their direct opposites - materialistic and down-to earth. Before he managed to bore us to death with his rants, or do something obscene, we managed to get him to share his knowledge of VooDoo in exchange for letting him go. He also shared some of his knowledge of genetics, but it'll take some learnin' before we even begin to understand it.","STR_RET_MECHTOID_UFOPEDIA":"Inside this walking trashcan we found some important bits of Reticulan body, like the brain, the livers and the splanch, hooked up to a central cybernetic unit through a series of tubes and plastic bags.

Extremely fast reflexes and great shooting abilities combined with an utter lack of mercy. Despite biological parts, it's basically a killer robot, immune to pain, stun, smoke and bleeding. Flies fast and easily dodges melee attacks, even when attacked from behind. Its only apparent weakness seems to be fire.","WASPITE_ARMOR":"Waspite Examination","WASPITE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA":"These monstrosities are part organic, part robotic, all trouble. They're protected by strong Plastasteel and Chitin armor, resistant to plasma, laser and chem. We can butcher their corpses to harvest PS and Hellerium.","STR_DEMONIC_ESSENCE_PREQ":"Dark Ones Summary","STR_DEMONIC_ESSENCE_PREQ_UFOPEDIA":"After examining a live Dark One in every way we could devise, we failed to establish any sort of contact, exorcise the demon, or find any useful info at all. Being such a diligent person, I've ordered butchering of its fresh corpse, and finally we got something. Beside normal human-like organs, the insides of Dark Ones are filled with a gelatinous substance we dubbed 'demonic essence'. After death, this stuff quickly breaks down, creating that foul stench that forces us to use so much space to store the Dark One corpses. The carcasses themselves are useless, but I think that with proper sorcery, the 'essence' could be harvested from freshly slain Dark Ones - it HAS to hold some dark power... Thus I recommend we keep any caught Dark Ones in my dungeon for now, hmmm...","STR_DOOM_HUMAN_AUTOPSY":"The Dark Ones","STR_DOOM_HUMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"They appear to be human, but they feel no fear, pity or awe; if they come into contact with anything that isn't them, they do not communicate - they just kill, without hesitation. There could be only one scientific explanation: they're possessed by demons.","STR_DOOM_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}And we thought demons were supposed to be tough. This creature, after being disarmed, could only struggle pointlessly - a strong Brainer gal was enough to restrain it. When we showed him some cheap VooDoo fetishes to maybe avert the possession, it sent him crawling up the walls, babbling incoherently, then when we applied some more, he dropped to the floor, foaming from his mouth and convulsing. Curious. Well, the possession wasn't gone but at least he finally kind of calmed down. So, we proceeded to interrogate, but to no avail. After some milling about, someone had the idea that we need to turn to professional works in that field - and we happen to have an old tome called 'Malleus Malleficarum', which proclaims itself as the leading source on that topic. Sadly, when we put the demon interrogation practices found there to work, the patient died even quicker than a pureblood probably would, if one would be so ignorant as to use such techniques on a non-possessed person.","STR_DOOM_SARGE_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}At first we thought that all the Dark Ones were male. Well, at least a certain someone was strongly arguing to be the case, being into that sort of fetishes. She was rather disappointed by these less humanlike demons, who don't conform to such fantasies and are only equipped for violence. None the less, after we stripped the creature nude and examined it in minute details, the results were curious. Unlike its outward looks would have you assume, it lacks any male 'equipment' except the bare minimum needed for urination. We went back to corpses of killed Dark Ones, and all were the same on the outside - but at least a few had clearly female bone structure. Creepy","STR_DOOM_GUNNER_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}These burly brutes, dubbed 'gunners' for their preference of heavy weapons, are the strongest and biggest of the possessed humans, none the less, their toughness comes mostly from their patchwork armor. They do not seem more resilient to physical damage than a tough Pureblood, not even mentioning ourselves. However, there is a difference - they seem to be hardly affected by poisons, they're almost impossible to stun, and their fury is so all-consuming, they're completely immune to any compelling or threatening. However they react rather badly to any Evil VooDoo-related stuff, even if it's just trinkets. Now find me another subject, this one is of no use anymore.","STR_DOOM_IMP":"Imp Demon","DOOM_ARMOR_4":"Imp Battle Report","STR_DOOM_IMP_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"We can only conclude these creatures didn't come from this Earth, but, quite literally, from Hell. These low-ranking demons throw fireballs at us like there's no tomorrow, which makes them quite dangerous. NV: 30. ThV: 50%","STR_DOOM_IMP_UFOPEDIA":"Fast and vicious types with a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fire and a good aim. If your Hands aren't completely fireproof, underestimating them Imps only because they're not hard to kill can quickly turn our raid into a literal Hell. When up close and personal, they can also use their claws.","STR_DOOM_HELL_BARON":"Baron of Hell","DOOM_ARMOR_5":"Baron of Hell Battle Report","STR_DOOM_HELL_BARON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"These towering monsters are very rare and very hard to kill. They appear to be demon commanders, and can conjure projectiles of extremely potent chem from thin air. The corpse is so foul it requires a lot of space to store safely and it's better sold immediately; there are various creepy characters willing to pay a nice coin for it. NV: 40. SPOT: 10. ThV: 60%","STR_DOOM_HELL_BARON_UFOPEDIA":"We thought we'd be able to somehow communicate with this guy, as he - or it? It appears genderless - but how to communicate when he doesn't speak, doesn't react to words, and any touch is harmful to deadly? One brainer said she heard it saying, I cite, 'Naebk'aesae Zaesraebae Ibx'o Avaxaer'vtae', but she probably simply made that up, if you want to know my opinion.","STR_DOOM_DEMON":"Pinky Demon","STR_DOOM_SPECTRE":"Spectre Demon","DOOM_ARMOR_6":"Demon Battle Report","STR_DOOM_DEMON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"This beastie can bite your head clean off.

ThV: 50%","STR_DOOM_DEMON_UFOPEDIA":"A careful examination of this creature of muscle, teeth, fury and little else, revealed remains of what seemed like an artificial leg, fused with the monster's own hind leg. Was this creature once a human?","STR_DOOM_SPECTRE_UFOPEDIA":"Spectres are nigh-invisible, especially in the dark. Be careful for these jaws.

ThV: 50%","STR_DOOM_CACODEMON_UFOPEDIA":"No idea how it was able to float, spit plasma or, frankly speaking, live at all. Performance tests revealed its weapon has roughly twice the power of a Handcannon, but both speed and reactions were really bad. It took a lot to finally kill it, though.","STR_SHADOWS_UFOPEDIA":"Called by many names, they're a myth that keeps on living despite all Star Gods efforts to deny it. It is a popular belief that as there are Gods, there must be devils as well. Devils whom even the Gods fear. It is said they've waged a secret war for millions of years. Shadowmasters are known for bestowing powerful and dangerous gifts to those who they find worthy. Some say they're the same beings as Lokk'Naar gods. Whether it's true or not, this knowledge will open many doors.","STR_SHADOWTECH_UFOPEDIA":"Some of the crafts we can buy from the Lokk'Naars contain mysterious equipment slots, marked as 'STC'. It is impossible to tell what kind of systems or weapons can be mounted there, since they're unlike any tech we've ever seen. Their name is known only in fearful whispers: 'Shadowtech'.","STR_SHADOWREALM_UFOPEDIA":"We have divined that the beings behind 'Shadowtech' must reside in the 'shadow' of the perceptible world: a dimension where none of the physical forces we know works (neither gravity, magnetism nor nuclear forces). No Shadowtech seems to really rely on these. Instead, it uses two unknown forces we dubbed 'dark force' and 'light force'. Whatever they are, they must leave even the Star Gods puzzled. ","STR_CYBERDISC_UFOPEDIA":"This miniature flying saucer, commonly used by the Academy, is the Star Gods' automated terror weapon armed with an extremely powerful plasma beam (Rating 130) which the machine fires with high frequency and accuracy.  The anti-grav propulsion gives it a big advantage in difficult terrain. NV: 20.","STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY":"Cyberdisc Wreckage Examination","STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"We have dug through the wreckage of this 'Cyberdisc' to find out if we can use this formidable machine to our needs. Good and bad news, Cap'n. Good news is, the machine is extremely robust, and the core anti-grav unit is repairable; we could bring this machine back and get it to fight on our side. Bad news is, we need a custom-tailored Slave AI to replace the current one. And there is the thing you're going to like the least - the plasma weapon it was firing at us is far too arcane to repair.","ADRONE_ARMOR":"Academy Drone Examination","STR_ADRONE_UFOPEDIA":"A flying device used by the Academicians to scout dangerous areas and exterminate whatever findings they don't like. Armed with an average-powered laser weapon. Well-armored, but its inner workings are very fragile. NV: 16.","STR_BOOMOSAURUS_UFOPEDIA":"Used by the Traders Guild as a mobile rocket platform, the Boomosaurus is a beautiful but ill-tempered beast. Making full use of their arcane arts of bio-engineering, the Traders equipped it with a rocket launcher, which the Boomosaurus can use by itself, though it has bad aim and is easily distracted. Raised to cause havoc and obliteration among those who treaded on the Guild's heel, these lizards are deadly to landlubbers, but we can make short work of them! Just don't use fire on one, it'll only get angrier.","BOOMOSAURUS_ARMOR":"Boomosaurus Examination","STR_BOOMOSAURUS_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"As you probably noticed, this big lizard has a rocket launcher mounted on its back. The rack houses up to 8 incendiary missiles. Cutting through the Boomosaurus' scaly skin took some time, so perhaps it could be good material for armor. What we discovered inside was nothing special, but perfectly edible; it tastes best when roasted in garlic, and even better with some rum. NV: 9.","STR_SHAMBLER_UFOPEDIA":"White Shamblers are big and strong biped animals, that inhabit caves of various cold areas of the globe. They stun or kill their prey with fists before dragging them off to their hideouts to eat later (wearing a strong helmet is advised to survive such treatment). Their expensive fur hides a heavily-muscled body resistant to Piercing and especially Concussive damage. The beasts are too dumb and too savage to communicate with.","STR_CHRYSSALID_UFOPEDIA":"And boom, who the hell brought this beast alive to our hideout?! The responsible (and I have a few ideas who would that be) should be punished, and not in the way they'd like. You, Cap'n, can enjoy this snapshot.","CHRYSSALID_ARMOR":"Chryssalid Examination","STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"The exo-skeleton of this creature is extremely tough, almost crystal-like, hence the (improper) name Crystalisk. The creature is infamous for its overwhelming urge to impregnate. While some of the hands may find this exciting, the mate does not survive. Given the monster's extremely energetic chemistry, the victim turns into a fresh Chryssalid within a minute. SENSE: 8. NV: 25. ThV: 100%. CAMO: 8/4","STR_REAPER_UFOPEDIA":"So yeah, we have now our own pet Reaper that is running about the base, shedding hair and leaving teeth marks everywhere. I hope you're happy with that, Cap'n. Maybe we should construct some sort of a Reaper Pit under your bridge.","REAPER_ARMOR":"Reaper Examination","STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"This furry carnivore has powerful jaws and a voracious appetite. It's hard to put down for good, since it has two 'brains' and two 'hearts' (the latter are pretty tasty when fried with onion).  The Traders breed them to terrorize their enemies, but also for their hides that fetch a good price. Beasts used in warfare are controlled via cybernetic implants. NV: 16.","CELATID_ARMOR":"Fartbag Examination","STR_CELATID_UFOPEDIA":"Our captured Fartbag seems to favor those of high magical aptitude - as its favorite food, I mean - so it must have some magical properties itself, but we never noticed anything special about it, naturally besides its uncanny ability to detect living beings. Which is strange and makes me a bit worried. Well, the conclusion is: if you see them, kill them fast.","STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"They call'em Celatids, we call'em Fartbags. They spit acid and it melts people to slag. We're not sure where these little monsters came from, but they're certainly imported from some other Imperial world. The Beastmasters control them with magic. Fartbags are blind, but can detect any living being close-by, even through walls (SENSE: 20).

SENSE: 20","STR_SILACOID_UFOPEDIA":"This little bugger breathes fire, chomps on rocks and is even less cuddly than it looks. Despite our best efforts, we failed to train it, as it only seems to respond to powerful magical spells that are beyond our best adepts. To make things even worse, we can't eat it any more than we can eat stones. In the end it, uh, escaped by digging a tunnel with its..uh.. let's call them teeth; the rock was both chewed and melted with acid. if I don't see it again in my life, I totally can live with that.","SECTOPOD_ARMOR":"SECTOPOD Examination","STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA":"This horrifying machine is controlled not by some circuitry, but by a living, enslaved brain. It was doubtlessly forged in the very pits of Hell and serves the Star Gods where their evil magics fail and a vulgar display of brute force is needed.

Not for Jack.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_SOLDIER_X_UFOPEDIA":"Freak Ubers are mutants which, sometimes, have physical abilities, including VooDoo potential, above the normal maximum.

This one has a scope, which you might consider a brave design, but it does help to hit your targets at long range. Plus, it looks extra intimidating, which helps to look serious and businesslike without any armor or clothing on. Don't know what a Magnum is? Buy and research it!","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_HARPOON_CARBINE_UFOPEDIA":"To appropriate treasures of the deep sea, one has also to face its dangers, so it's necessary to arm yourself!

Even more so, the bigger you grow, the more cleaning is necessary to keep you going. But nobody asks you to do it bare-handed! This gun will prove very helpful in fast removal of any garbage.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_MILITARY_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA":"Enter the market of real military hardware, and never again worry about shortages of standard firearms or ammo.

Use either stealth or distraction to maximize Reactions, which are crucial for this gun. It will prove especially useful in missions which require both infiltration gear and quietness.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_MARTIAL_ARTS_UFOPEDIA":"So, do you wish to become a Warrior? Hard training is the only key. You need to develop proper training regimes, taking into account your advantages and disadvantages. Knowing yourself is half of winning the battle. I can only help you to make the first step. You must find out about your abilities, origins of mutants, healthy cuisine, sports and medicine, before you will be able to establish your own Dojos. Does your pretty head hurt already? No pain, no gain! Stop being useless!","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_DURATHREAD_UFOPEDIA":"If you're lacking Durathread to make light armor and other stuff useful for covert missions, the Alliance can share. For a price. Our fighters are often outfitted with Durathread equipment and we run many small manufactures where we make it. Don't know what Durathread is? I recommend you buy and research some ASAP. Subpar equipment just won't do when the fate of all mutantkind is at stake.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_ALLIANCE_FAVORS_UFOPEDIA":"The Alliance needs your help, and is very glad you're part of the solution, not a part of the problem. To keep things that way, we will share with you the old SKYRANGER craft. Also, the Alliance Files are now available. For each one you research, we will lend you our tactical advice and use our pull to improve your political standing.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_ASG12_UFOPEDIA":"When working for the Alliance, precision is highly valued. However, brute force is often equally needed to deliver all due punishment to the enemies of mutantkind. This weapon, while quite expensive, combines both, as long as you're not a coward who disdains close-range assassination. It is also kinda heavy, but that's because it contains so much justice.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_SPIKE_ROCKETS_UFOPEDIA":"Mutant Rebels use and manufacture Spike Rockets by a thousand. From now on, we will freely sell them to your forces as well.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_HOLOSUIT_UFOPEDIA":"Armor is so cumbersome and obscures your beauty. Employ stealth to avoid getting killed instead. If you dare.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_LUNAR_WARD_UFOPEDIA":"It is not the ability to release energy that makes a wizard. It requires something more subtle and elegant... something called magic. The realm of possible impossibilities. It is only when you withstand a direct hit with a Ghost Beam and - just smile - then, the truly impossible happens.","STR_BOUNTY_HUNTING_PRIZE_WIZ_BOOKS_UFOPEDIA":"Welcome to the Wizard Library.

Even if a zine contains pictures, you can still read the corresponding text! This opens up a whole new way to acquire information. In that way we learned, in ancient times there was a man, who worked as some kind of newsperson. He was completely inept and even his girlfriend thought he was a dork. But when he donned his costume, he became very strong, shot lasers from his eyes und generally stopped being his useless self. However, because he looked ridiculous in this costume of his, everybody pretended not to recognize him when he wore it. Anyways, here is our plan. To use this mighty voodoo, we replicate this costume, dress up a slave and shove him in the direction of our enemies. All we need are some rags and pigments refined from soylent blue and soylent red. What could possibly go wrong?","STR_CORPSE_SUPER_SLAVE_UFOPEDIA":"It appears that all we got from our carefully planned and conducted procedure was a slave in a silly cape. Retracing our steps we noticed a flaw in our initial data. It seems that the brainer tasked with evaluating the source material was not properly trained in our new method of actually reading the text and just looked at the pictures. We can guarantee that such a mistake will not happen again. Meanwhile, diligent cross-referencing revealed that the voodoo does not stem solely from the costume itself, but that a suitable wearer has to be bitten by a radioactive critter first. Then, the voodoo unfolds from an interaction between costume and wearer. ATM we have some very promising leads concerning severely radiated bats. Expect a research proposal soon!","STR_GREEN_LIGHTER_UFOPEDIA":"Apparently, the gals don't believe in drugs. That can be quite a nuisance during prolonged battles, as even the toughest of our gals need a break after a few hours of constant skirmish. And here is our solution. Despite the superslaves' rather disappointing performance (which was in no way our fault), the gals still believe in superheroes! Well, if it takes another slave in a silly costume for the gals to take their medicine, so be it. With our tested procedure (we knew this would come in handy), we will dress up another slave, tell the gals that he is imbued with Hellerium, and that he can recharge them with his magical smoke. They will know this to be true, because there are some historic zines about a voodoo lighter recharging a voodoo necklace or something. Nay, of course there is no actual need to involve any nuclear fuel! The slave will just supply good old pervitin.","STR_CORPSE_GREEN_LIGHTER_UFOPEDIA":"Yes, there was nuclear fuel involved.

Either he is fighting some weird clown or he is banging this batlad Robby Werham. No wonder the gals absolutely love batbuddy! But no matter how often we let our radioactive bats bite our test slaves, no superpowers emerged. So we focused on the mechanical aspect and built this really cool bat armor with an extra-strong cape. But... The gals insisted that (a) the armor is obviously a toy, (b) batbuddy didn't have any superpowers, it was all in the armor, only, it clearly isn't, and (c) back armor is useless. One of the brainerz (not me of course) replied that an armored back was perfect for running away with the booty. Some comments about the size of certain backsides, especially their lower parts, followed. Then, fists were flying. In the end, we reached a compromise. The gals will continue to use the bat armor as a toy and a combat capable slave will test it in battle.","STR_CORPSE_BAT_GLAD_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Well, maybe this design needs some more front armor.

It will either fight our enemies deliciously or bake delicious cookies for us - depends on whether this blot here is an umlaut mark or just a squashed insect. Oh, right, and we'll need a professional summoning circle, too.","STR_LIBER_OCCULTIS_TRANSLATED_UFOPEDIA":"Forcing a Church Reverend to translate the book yielded a ton of chaotic information, which took a real effort to piece together into a comprehensible form, which is as follows.{NEWLINE}The first part of the book concerns Church cosmology. It claims that the Stellar Empire dates back millions of years ago. They were busy seeding life on various planets, until a mysterious enemy, known only by the name of 'Inciters' appeared. A schism took place - the Star Gods as we know them today abandoned the old ways to better fight the war; other Star Gods, henceforth called the Elder Gods, claimed that convenience doesn't justify abandoning the old ways. The Church, therefore, is obedient to the Empire, but it also secretly holds the Star Gods to be imperfect.{NEWLINE}The second part of the book concerns Church philosophy, described by words Pleasure in Perfection, Elegance in Timing, Refuge in Creation. Reading between the verses, you can feel their loathing towards the Academy in particular, but also, strangely, towards the Reticulans. In contrast, the Deep Ones are seen as pure.{NEWLINE}The third, most exciting part, concerns performing VooDoo rites - we're ready to start experiments at any time!","STR_CHURCH_RITUALS_UFOPEDIA":"In pursuit of their 'perfection', the Church secretly delves into unspeakable debauchery, consorting with all kinds of bizarre, deadly monsters.

And the war parts do not provide any useful information on military technology or tactics! Still, a lot of the other brainerz want to read it, too. Well, I guess you cannot judge a book by its cover. Oh, that reminds me why I've asked you here Cap'n! Some of these thinner books with lots of pictures in them have very intriguing covers. It seems that in ancient times, there was a tribe of mighty voodoo handlers that for some inexplicable reasons wore their underwear on the outside. We should definitely take a closer look at those zines - as we brainerz call them. Maybe we can use their voodoo for our purposes.","STR_PSI_LAB_UFOPEDIA":"We have gained a basic understanding of the art of magic. Voodoo Strength of all Hands is visible now.","STR_PSI_EXCESS_UFOPEDIA":"While Church priests use the mind-magic of the Star Gods to some degree, the real nature of their sorcery is very, very different. Only our own forays into the realm of decadence allowed us to understand it.

It can be used to play tricks, alter minds, become invisible, etc. - let your imagination run wild! To actually master their most fabled power, the power to control one's mind, we need to better know our physiology, and interrogate an Academy Provost.","STR_PSI_DESTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"There's no shortage in destructive power delivered by technology. Yet, the same science of death can be further augmented, in some fields, by treading the sorcerous path of Destruction. It can be used to sharpen one's killing instincts, but the greatest power lies in directing the flow of energy: naturally-occurring energy of elements can be tapped and hurled towards enemies, or the energy of enemy attacks can be dissipated by enhanced armor (plasma energy will prove the most troublesome). We'll also need actual combat tech before we can enhance it.","STR_PSI_COMMUNION_UFOPEDIA":"This sorcerous path of Reticulan origin emphasizes cooperation, growth and acceptance, both in mental as well as physical aspects. While its practices are disgusting to some, or downright creepy, others say that the power of love conquers all, and unity leads to immortality. While I have my doubts, it seems this kind of VooDoo has the greatest potential to counter Star Gods' trickery.","STR_DEMONIC_RITUALS_UFOPEDIA":"Dabbling into the dark magics, we have discovered a way for Demonic Essence to be gained through ritual sacrifice in a Summoning Circle. {NEWLINE}Yes it does involve cold-blooded murder of defenceless slaves, was that unclear, Cap'n?! Don't blame the scientist!","STR_MOST_COMMON_POWER_UFOPEDIA":"While the gals got all preoccupied with the male superheroes of Old Earth, the more diligent minds studied the superheroines as well. And a startling finding was made - judging by the looks of it, their superpowers seem to be directly related to the size of their chests. The gals do not lack in that department, but some catalysts and knowledge are needed before we can unleash these powers upon the unsuspecting world! The picture should provide us with some pointers.","STR_PIRATEY_LINGERIE_UFOPEDIA":"The elites hold that Durathread clothing is unfashionable and should be only used for menial work, while expensive designer underwear ranges from flimsy to edible, easily torn to keep the sales going.

Instead of Hellerium, it uses some nasty substance called 'liquid deuterium'. The overall performance seems to be much inferior to that of Hellerium-fired Ship Engines, and it's hard to tell how abundant this 'liquid deuterium' is, so we don't expect to get a good market price on these devices.","STR_SECTOWEED_UFOPEDIA":"Smoking this plant makes you all comfy-like and you're not bothered by the pain all that much.

No it totally wasn't laziness!","STR_ORANGE_UFOPEDIA":"I'm afraid that if it wasn't about oranges, this avenue of research would be completely fruitless.","STR_EVIL_GRASS_UFOPEDIA":"This usually docile grass grows in many parts of the world. It doesn't normally pose a threat, but when disturbed by grazing animals (or landing of a ship, for that matter) it tries to snare any mobile lifeforms with its strong, flexible strands. It doesn't pose a real threat to anyone, unless you doze off for many hours in it and let yourself be digested. In battle conditions, the Evil Grass slows down movement. I suggest using explosives - take that, Grass!","STR_MUTANT_MEAT_UFOPEDIA":"Juicy, tasty and crunchy! Sure brings memories of our ol' sich, doesn't it, Cap'n? I suggest taking a few fer a mission, just to keep them spirits high! Meat will replenish 3 Health, 50 Morale and 50 Energy, but will make you sleepy, so wash it down with some water or Rum!","STR_CAKE_UFOPEDIA":"This foodstuff is so insanely good that I think I got instantly hooked on it! Not only it does taste like heaven (thus fully restoring morale on use), it also has a great effect on both the body (instant +20 HP boost) and mind (helps with Reactions and Bravery improvement).","STR_BOOT_UFOPEDIA":"Useless, decaying piece of footwear. It doesn't even have a matching other boot. Curses!","STR_SKULL_UFOPEDIA":"An old humanoid skull.

Worth anywhere between 200 and 20000 Dolaros ($). There are (downplayed by the Guild) rumors about these chips being hackable, at least up to the Silver level, but nothing substantial. The Lokk'Naars are willing to give us the full Dolaros value in exchange, so either they don't know about these rumors, or they do know and have some plan on how to profit on them.","STR_CREDIT_CHIP_C_UFOPEDIA":"The Guild and the Govts have been long discussing pros and cons of introducing a $100 credit chip. Values of mobility were weighed against security, various tribunes of public interests clashed with black knights of corporate greed, all to no avail. Well, until now. Our sucking up to all these fools was not in vain. We have managed to win a political campaign to introduce this new, promising coin!

Huzzah for the literal showers of money we can now forge!!!","STR_OBSIDIAN_CRACK_UFOPEDIA":"With the humming of our Computer Core audible even here, it's not surprising we've become the masters of money manipulation. Obsidian Chips can now be broken down into Golden ones for stratospherical profit, although we'll need an Industrial Printer installed beside our Mint. And acquire physical Gold for the chips, too.","STR_ECONOMIC_FUNDAMENTALS_UFOPEDIA":"From now on, we can mint our own Obsidian Chips.

Must be magic!","STR_CRYSTAL_SKULL_UFOPEDIA":"There are very few legends that cross over cultures and times the way the crystal skull legends do. They are contemporarily shared by indigenous people all around the world. These legends have been handed down from generation to generation for thousands of years, which attests to their enduring power. It is said each skull contains '13 spirits of power', imprisoned into the skull even before any human or mutant existed.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Crystal skulls are obviously ancient Star God devices for mind reading.

Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.

On one hand you see the masculine part of the stone within its phallic shape, and the feminine as well in the egg shape, and in the beauty of the markings on the stones. The stone as a whole recognizes that they are one, yet they are each a separate entity within the one. {NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Sivalinga Stones will intensify the vitality and level of pranic energy within your body if you are fatally wounded. To improve your overall health these stones are powerful as they stimulate the energy system of the entire body, and will aid an overall improvement in your health and well-being (7 health per heal). However, the proper application of the stone is very tiring to the healer.","STR_TORCH_UFOPEDIA":"Throw it on the ground to provide night-time lighting.

But if it isn't to be a poor-man's suicide mission, we need an interstellar-capable ship, fitted with technology as advanced as possible, to fully free ourselves from being shackled to this planet. We have codenamed it 'CONQUEROR'. Here's a broad outline:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>ROBUST HULL. Not only do we need the best hull tech, but likely also a very large manufacturing facility to house it.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>BIG ENGINE. Star God modular design just won't do, we need a single, big engine for maximum space and fuel efficiency.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>FUEL CELLS. Likewise, we can't haul an enormous fuel tank with us, so some kind of supercharged fuel is our only hope.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>HABITATION. We obviously need to survive inside the ship, in reasonable luxury, and ideally for months at least.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>BRIDGE. Likely the most complex component, the brains of the ship.","STR_MARS_CAPSULE_PROJECT_UFOPEDIA":"Getting to Mars may be simpler than we think. We just need a huge Hellerium-filled rocket to deliver a small pod to the target, then we, I mean our Hands, can finish off the Solar Governor and hope for the best! Missiles and Space Suits are the key researches to develop such a craft.","STR_PIRATEZ_BACKGROUND_UFOPEDIA":"Legends say once the Earth was ruled by humans, and there were no mutants at all. Even if such tall tales are true, it is all long gone. Nowadays the planet is just a distant periphery of the huge stellar Empire, ruled by the Star Gods. A poor backwater with corrupt government and brainwashed population, rife with crime - and opportunity. Mutants and outcasts like us are not loved by anyone, so we choose infamy over their sick and unjust order. They may call us pirates and criminals but it's better to die free than live for others.","STR_PIRATEZ_UBERS_UFOPEDIA":"We the Ubers live in zones heavily irradiated by centuries of Hellerium fallout, scattered all over the world. These so-called 'Uber Zones', or simply 'Zones', are avoided by everyone else, in part because radiation is bad for their health, but mostly for the extremely dangerous fauna and flora that lives there that only locals know how to handle or avoid. Of the outsiders, only the zone-savvy 'Stalkers' dare to venture into our Zones, mainly to buy monster hides and sell tech. It is not uncommon for a Black Market's trading post to be located near a Zone, but their prices on most goods are outrageous. For us, leaving Zones for too long is quite lethal; most Ubers get sick and die, and those who survive (known as 'Striders'), lose most of our mutant powers. To safely operate outside of the Zones, we must constantly consume irradiated drinks and food, making us unable to expand territorially even if we wanted to.","STR_ENVIRO_UFOPEDIA":"It is dangerous for us to leave the Zones, especially if you're unprepared. The most common conditions you will encounter are Heat and Cold, although acid rains aren't unheard of; check your outfits for resistances.{NEWLINE}>Heat. Intense hotness will cause Gals to lose focus and thus accumulate Stun damage, 8 per turn if resistance = 100%.{NEWLINE}>Cold. Freezing will drain 8 Energy and inflict 2 Stun per turn.

These units are only visible from a number of tiles specified, not a tile further.{NEWLINE}>SPOT: Reduces both by its value, can differ Day/Night.","STR_HEATVISION_UFOPEDIA":"Heat, or thermal vision (ThV) is employed by electronic sights, like those normally used by human carapace and powered armor, but it's also a natural feature of various beasts, aliens and monsters. A unit with Heat Vision ignores a set amount of Smoke (in percentage) for the purpose of spotting. This makes smokescreens less than fully effective against many types of enemies.{NEWLINE}Note that ThV rating only describes behaviour vs. Smoke, not the actual Nightvision range (NV).","STR_SOULSENSE_UFOPEDIA":"Soulsense, also called Inner Eye, ESP etc. is an ability to spot living beings through mystical means. It is coded as SENSE, and allows one to see through darkness, smoke and even walls, up to stated range. Naturally, the Star Gods and their magic are known for powerful SENSE, however, some monsters might possess supernatural sense of smell or vibration, or whatever, which also counts as SENSE. Note that SENSE doesn't allow spotting non-sentient beings, like normal robots or droids.","STR_VIOLENCE_UFOPEDIA":"As we do battle, our enemies will do their best to end our lives. Cunning brutality is the most direct answer. We can devise weapons to help with that worthy endeavour, but it is up to you, Cap'n, to train the gals in brutality and come up with cunning tactics.","STR_SURVIVAL_UFOPEDIA":"It's a dangerous world out there, and we be needing to learn how to get tougher and live off the land. To achieve that, we need weapons and armor; and preferably such that don't need many resources to be made.","STR_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA":"The art of telling someone to sod off in a such way that they'll start to feel a rising excitement about the upcoming journey.

The poor sods will be naturally stripped of their possessions (you'll see the familiar shorthand info on the material gains, just like with the slavery), but instead of an obedient slave, you'll get a 'Broken' person at the other end. These can be then invited back here, and with enough extra time with me, be sure that any secrets they have hidden until now will be revealed.{NEWLINE}Please take note that to arrange a proper softening-up course, we need to have completed a normal interrogation of their peer first, you didn't expect everything on the first date, did you?","STR_EMANCIPATION_UFOPEDIA":"Slavery is the curse of our times. Slavery builds economies, but at some point it becomes obsolete next to the power we get from machines. We can now educate and equip our slaves to send them into the world as free people and spread the civilization. This will cost us money and time, but the free flow of ideas will grant us new knowledge (each Emancipation project, listed under Slavery, produces a Data Disc; a Library is required).","STR_STARDOM_UFOPEDIA":"I had a vision, Cap'n - let's aim for the very top and become world-class idols! With enough popularity, we can have everything, criminals turned warriors of love! Instead of crude methods of slavery, we can now charm people to do work for us!

To keep both the staff and customers happy, while retaining discipline, and some sort of dignity - it takes willpower, charisma and proper swag.{NEWLINE}We can now either manufacture our own Mutant Porn (the actors will be set free after a session), or make captured Hoes (and similarly inclined captives) work for us as Courtesans, who occupy 8 Space but earn us $25k monthly.","STR_PERSUASION_UFOPEDIA":"Honed persuasive powers will allow us to interrogate VIPs and broaden our slavery and recruitment options.","STR_SALVAGE_UFOPEDIA":"Yes, it's a shady business, but you don't have to indulge in it, and these people were already slaves to the Star Gods anyway. Will you be a kinder master than them, Cap'n? The Slavery option is available in the Workshop, and it permanently turns a prisoner into a slave. A slave is worth less money than a pristine hostage, but will generate monthly income and storage space through the power of human networking. He or she will also be relieved of their possessions, just like through Robbery. Some enemies cannot be enslaved, and some require extra tech to do so.","STR_UNDERGROUND_HUNTING_UFOPEDIA":"It was never a secret that some things be living in the radioactive sludge beneath our hideout. We used to fear them, but we know better now! If we send properly equipped Runts into the caves, they should, probably, likely return with some catches, like meat, chitin and maybe even a rare geode. We need an Extractor present to undertake this enterprise.","STR_CUISINE_UFOPEDIA":"Soylent not good. Meat good. Prime cuts not only can raise morale, but also fetch us some hefty prices on the market. Once them damned Runts learn to cook... in the literal, not obliteral, sense of the word. Which sounds like a real challenge... but definitely worth risking the kitchen being blown up a few times.","STR_FORGERY_UFOPEDIA":"Procuring data on how the banking and government transactions work, as well as making some contact with criminals, we were able to come up with a way to forge money, using generally-available human ID cards. However, to get the printing press going, we have yet to figure out how to make a proper mint.","STR_BEASTMEN_TAMING_UFOPEDIA":"We did some reading of them Old Books, and so there was this guy called Enkidu, and he was like, a Beastman, only a cool one. And he was turned into a fine man by one priestess, using the art of love and magic of reading. I guess some medical procedure was also applied to make him look better.","STR_ANIMAL_TAMING_UFOPEDIA":"Animals and monsters can be hunted and butchered, but learning how to make them do as we say is a higher achievement. Animals can help us in combat, and the skills we've developed can help ourselves survive in the wasteland as well.","STR_SKINNING_UFOPEDIA":"Through the study of monster species, we have developed techniques to recover their hides and other valuable body parts.{NEWLINE}Butchery of corpses and livestock is available at Workshop, under Extraction category, marked with a B letter. Numbers in parentheses correspond to: hides, meat, misc items.","STR_KEVLAR_WEAVING_UFOPEDIA":"The Old Earth Books contain knowledge of a material, called Kevlar, used by ancient humans to craft their personal armor. While it hardly protected against anything else than bullets and shrapnel (which can explain the human defeat), it was lightweight and flexible. It can be quite easily reproduced using our lab equipment.","STR_ROBOT_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA":"We have learned to disassemble captured robots for spare parts & profit. Check the Disassembly section in the Workshop menu. You can only disassemble robots you have researched first. You will always get that robot's chassis, like from a destroyed one, plus weapon parts and other junk.","STR_PIRATEZ_HIERARCHY_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}Each caste is divided into several tiers. The bottom of the ladder consists of Minions, whose purpose is to conduct day-to-day tasks of the caste, and Security, who are charged with keeping everyone else safe. Above them are specialists of various kinds: Pilots, Engineers, Medics etc. who can be exchanged for a better ransom or interrogated for any secrets they may hold - such secrets will prove crucial to our advancement. Their superiors are the middle-level leaders: the Reps, the Espers and the Reverends, but interrogating these beasts will be useless without sufficient preparation. On the very top of the hierarchy are VIPs; the richest and the most powerful.","STR_PERSONAL_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA":"We have conducted some studies on the commercially available types of personal armor. In general, they're based on lightweight, but extremely durable materials - like polymers (called 'aqua plastics' for some reason) and quasi-organic fibres to withstand armor-piercing ammunition. They're sometimes reinforced with 'magno-alloys', which are electricity and heat superconductors, which helps to dissipate energies unleashed by laser weapons which have otherwise little trouble digging through armor. With this technical knowledge, we might start to dream about developing (i.e. jury-rigging) our own kinds of armor - and weapons to combat it.","STR_HEAVY_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"We have mastered one of the secrets of the Traders - large-scale plastasteel construction methods. Now we can actually design and manufacture our own ships, instead of just cobbling old fighter hulls together. We can also build Armored Vaults now.","STR_HABITATION_ADVANCE_UFOPEDIA":"The usefulness of comfy all-enviro habitation cannot be overstated, both in space exploration and on this ravaged planet alike.","STR_RETICULAN_GENETICS_UFOPEDIA":"Reticulans speak of a 'gene code zero' which is sacred to them, since it represents the perfect Sectoid. This code however can only be copied using rare ancient equipment, so it is a slow method to make new dudes. The Rets are desperately trying to find out how to mate with other species to breed Ret babies, but so far were only successful in breeding hybrids. They also are looking for ways to become stronger and better-suited to Earth by improving upon their sacred code zero, which probably means it's not so sacred after all. The super-quick regeneration we have witnessed on Sirens and Sectogres seems to be the most amazing effect of all this.","STR_RETICULAN_POWER_SYSTEMS_UFOPEDIA":"Reticulans use bizarre tech - it's not that the parts are anything unusual, but they are welded in ways that an Earthling just wouldn't think of. It's mostly made from collected material of various origin, which makes their systems look even uglier. They're working nonetheless, and pretty efficient, which makes them worth taking for our own use. The fact they're scavenged is actually good for us, since it makes their study and copying easier.","STR_RETICULAN_HIVE_UFOPEDIA":"While Reticulans do have individuality, their whole society seems to be following some sort of a hivemind mentality. No Reticulan, Siren or Sectogre will betray the hive willingly, and arguments or fights between them are virtually nonexistent. They also freely share property between themselves and have little inhibitions. We think this can be explained as a side effect of the VooDoo abilities of the Reticulans. Hybrids and slaves are much less affected by this hive effect.","STR_ADVANCED_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA":"As far as we know, chemical-propelled projectiles - aka firearms and missiles - were known on Earth for centuries and are still widely used; the Star Gods see little threat in those. But there are several groups of more powerful weapons, restricted in use to those whom the Star Gods trust. The least powerful of those are Laser weapons, supposedly developed on Earth around the time it was conquered. Laser weapons ignore 1/3rd of armor. More powerful and less common are Gauss weapons, of uncertain origin. They were designed for a race stronger than humans. Still, both groups operate on principles familiar enough that we could use them easily once we lay our hands on them. The third group, Plasma weapons, genuine weaponry of the Star Gods, requires much more arcane understanding...","STR_COMBAT_101_UFOPEDIA":"There be lots of stats and whatnots about weapons and armor. Smart reads here first.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*GUNS generally cause 0-200% of their base damage on any hit. Bonus POWER is added before any rolls. So if your attacks do not work, it's not always because the weapon sucks.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*EXPLOSIVES generally cause 50-150% of their base damage and are applied against BOTTOM armor if the explosion happens within 3 tiles of the target.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*RESISTANCES stated in the ARMOR entry modify the rolled damage by their %.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}*FINAL damage is reduced by the ARMOR value and applied to HEALTH if higher than armor, hopefully leading to DEATH.","STR_COMBAT_STRESS_UFOPEDIA":"Them gals can't help but be nervous in battle, since they'd rather live to see the treasure. A battle that goes on fer too long increases the risk of enemy reinforcements arriving or sumthin' else going awry (or she just gets bored). If a gal's Morale is higher than her Bravery, she will lose Morale every turn (and conversely, she will recover it if her Morale is lower than Bravery). Keep their enthusiasm high by killing enemies.","STR_EVASION_UFOPEDIA":"Evasion is an ability to dodge melee attacks (including shots fired within melee range). Most enemies will have some Evasion score. This score directly decreases the accuracy of melee attacks by its flat value. Lightly armed fighters will have Evasion based on Reactions, while heavily armored ones - on Melee. Some especially heavy armors and tanks have a flat Evasion score, representing the difficulty of landing blows on these. To attempt Evasion against firearms, you need 10 Energy, although it will be spent only if successful.","STR_DRESSUP_UFOPEDIA":"Prepare early, else you might end up having to fight nekkid!{NEWLINE}>You can change your outfit only in the Hideout. There are several ways: 'Hands', 'Armors', or by pressing 'A' in a Hand's Inventory.{NEWLINE}>Simple rags are available in unlimited quantity; all other outfits must be manufactured, looted or bought. Outfits worn by landlubbers are usually unfit for Ubers: wrong size, lack of style, unhealthy spirits. Newly hired Hands bring their own clothes.{NEWLINE}>Some items, like Adventurer or Pirate, are whole wardrobes rather than single outfits. If a Gal wants to change, but we have no spares, she needs to strip first.","STR_FINANCES_UFOPEDIA":"Our lil' enterprise might turn out to be profitable, but seven hells, doesn't it cost a lot of Dolaros to run. Buildings and crafts need to be maintained and powered, crew needs to be paid (especially these damned Brainers), all is paid at the start of any month. On the other hand, we're receiving Protection money from various countries. If we have enough Infamy at the end of the month, they will pay more, but if we make fools of ourselves, the payments can be reduced. Check your financial status either in Logs or Charts. Some things to be wary of:{NEWLINE}>Loot: loot can be sold, used or researched. If things go bad, there's always something to sell (including buildings){NEWLINE}>Manufacturing: some items are profitable to manufacture - this can be a good source of income.{NEWLINE}>Infamy Bonus: Each month we receive extra $333 per every Infamy point above 0. This is on top of normal payments and doesn't carry over.{NEWLINE}>Loan Sharks. These keep to the shadows but it's surprisingly easy to find one, especially if you're in bad financial shape. We can run into a negative balance, but if we do it twice in the row, we're goners. Better keep liquidity.","STR_PILOTING_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our crafts need at least a single pilot to fly, sometimes more. In case of multiple pilots, their skills are averaged. Relevant skills are Firing (accuracy bonus), Reactions (dodge bonus) and Bravery (approach speed).

How then to avoid being dispossessed, humiliated and discarded?{NEWLINE}>Keep Infamy higher than {NEWLINE}-500. You can make a slip once, but if you don't improve Infamy the next month, it will be a very clear sign for the crew that finding a new Cap'n is the only way to survive.{NEWLINE}>Don't go into too much debt. Again, you will have a month to reduce your debt to below $1M, else the crew will nominate you as a part of the collateral.","STR_LOOT_DISTRIBUTION_UFOPEDIA":"We had fun, now let's talk about money, to know what we're standing on and what to offer our potential comrades. The Escaped Lunatics, being part-owners, agreed to take no money unless they gain the rank of Boss Gal. New recruits won't usually be so generous.{NEWLINE}Did I mention ranks? Yes, the more gals we have, the more and higher ranking officers we'll need. Officers will get a monthly cash bonus: Boss Gal $20k, Mistress $100k, Baroness $400k, and Duchess $1.2M. One Boss per 4 Gals, one Mistress per 3 Bosses, one Baroness per 2 Mistresses. One Duchess per 69 total crew and never more than one. So say we, the crew.","STR_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA":"We can always find potential crew members amongst our fellow Ubers who visit Jack's Town.{NEWLINE}>Runts: Those gals who are either unwilling or unable to carry a gun, can be hired to operate our Workshops. They take $5,000 monthly pay.{NEWLINE}>Brainers: Weird gals who can be hired to staff our Lab. However, these beasts demand $100k monthly pay, so they can easily drive us into bankrupcy.{NEWLINE}>Hands: Those who will fight. Unlike our founding Escaped Lunatics, they must be paid at the end of each month: Swabbies $2500, Gals $7500. Note that it's easier to find a willing warrior than a skilled one, especially within our narrow demographic, so the quality of these troops will vary a lot.","STR_HOTKEYS_UFOPEDIA":"Oi, Cap'n...

To take an advantage of that, it is imperative to keep to the shadows.","STR_MUTANT_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA":"It seems all the variations of mutants we see (most famous being Lamias, Bugeyes and Brutes), ultimately come from the same source - the so-called 'Pureblood' humans who used to be the single race inhabiting the Earth. Nowadays, they universally cooperate with the Star Gods to retain their 'purity', amongst other things. But back to the point, since most of the mutant variants can be broken down into several discernible, stable and reproducing 'abhuman' strains, there is only one possible explanation - the Star Gods experimented on humans to custom-tailor slave races for their own ends. What remains on Earth are possibly their failed experiments, or ongoing experiments under observation, or some sort of reserves - the Star Gods have such abundance of resources. Whatever the truth is, the wealth of medical data we have gained could be immensely useful to us (check Factions).","STR_MUTANT_PHYSIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA":"After comparative analysis of Academy data, examinations of our soldiers and captured Raiders, we understand much more about ourselves. Like Raiders, we are members of the 'Uber' strain, stronger, faster and tougher than humans, with much denser muscle and skin. We owe all that to our metabolism which is able to process Hellerium. This also makes us radiate an aura of energy, which is responsible for our innate magical abilities.","STR_MEDICINE_UFOPEDIA":"It's no myth, it's the reality: when you go into a combat zone, injuries happen. The most dangerous are those which result in immediate death. Next in order are the aptly named Fatal Wounds. A wounded soldier loses as many HP's per turn as Fatal Wounds she has, until patched up or dead. Loss of health reduces all Combat Skills, reduces Energy Recovery and inflicts constant Stun damage. Fatal Wounds to arms and head drastically reduce Accuracy until healed, same with torso wounds reducing Energy Recovery and leg wounds - TUs.{NEWLINE}We'd like to experiment some more, Cap'n, but the hands are reluctant to participate, would you help us catch some volunteers?","STR_ADVANCED_MEDICINE_UFOPEDIA":"We have attained a level of biotechnology known only to the Star Gods' most trusted servants.

But while this is fun, the practical value of this discovery is even greater. We have opened up the way to advanced healing techniques, as well as combat drugs. Also, we can now manufacture Medical Supplies and sell them to the destitute population for a very good profit. Save the world, get rich!","STR_COMBAT_DRUGS_MANUFACTURING_UFOPEDIA":"Just shake and stir. Well, in reality it is more complex than that, and we need a Refinery built first, but then we can produce as much Combat Drugs as we please.

Using darts coated with new, super-potent tranquilizers makes taking hostages easier than ever before.","STR_STEALTHSUITS_UFOPEDIA":"Seems that the partial invisibility of the Stealthsuits is achieved by somehow bending visible light and electromagnetic radiation. This technology is very exotic and seems to operate on principles alien to Human or Star God technology as we know it. It bears resemblance to the VooDoo invisibility effects but seems to be completely unrelated to VooDoo.","STR_GRAV_CORPSE_UFOPEDIA":"After getting our hands on an anti-gravity unit, it wasn't all too hard to figure out how to make it work again.

To keep scoring, keep us funded and interested. Missions can be a bugger but research, especially interrogations, are a good source of infamy.{NEWLINE}>WORKSHOP. To manufacture good stuff, we need one. To have it, we need to get tools and understand them. Contact Merchants & Builders to get tools, research gun and tool construction, and special outfits for these idiots Runts so we can force some fun dress code on 'em.{NEWLINE}>SCIENCE. 'Fter Workshop, we'll need more lab equipment. Superconductors are the key, we also need nice protective gear so we can neglect wearing it. Also note that we're powerless to pursue higher tech if the low tech is completely neglected.","STR_SCHOOL_BOOKS_UFOPEDIA":"We have gathered enough books and manuals to get this whole sci business going on a wholly different level, possibly giving you laser guns or even immortality.

Build us a Library, will you?","STR_SCHOOLING_2_UFOPEDIA":"Reading books and solving equations surely has a lot of bad press in this world, and these tasks surely make one's head hurt, but the haters won't be laughing anymore when the fruits of these hard labours will become evident. Reason and thinking for oneself instead of listening to people is the only path to power.{NEWLINE}Our next step: we need to gather knowledge about superconductive circuits, chemistry and medicine, then launch the 'School Graduation' project.

Turns out, there's no magic to it - all we need are Industrial Printer and Powerplant, and some basic components. The process itself is extemely profitable, considering current Trader's Guild prices, and has the potential to seriously loosen the economical grip the Empire has on Earth. We can let this genie loose by researching the 'Rebel Trading' project that will replace one of recurring monthly enemy activities with friendly traffic that will generate us a steady increase in Notoriety.","STR_AIR_FILTRATION_UFOPEDIA":"To survive foul chemical vapours and not suffocate in the smoke and fumes, so endemic to the hostile environments outside, we have developed our own versions of protective gear.","STR_CHEMISTRY_UFOPEDIA":"After a lot of experimenting with blowing stuff up and burning it down, and even spraying it with acid to see what happens, we have gained more understanding of the underlying laws governing such stuff.

These secrets are now ours as well.","STR_MELEE_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}Melee weapons are characterized by high and dependable damage (50-150% damage roll), however using them effectively requires skilled Hands. Pay close attention to their stats, as weapons useless for a weakling might be deadly in the hands of a strong warrior; this is especially important considering the wild range of skills presented by newly hired Hands. Many enemies will Evade blows, making them land less frequently than the displayed accuracy suggests. Muscles, math and bold action are the keys to success; overconfidence and lack of tactical acumen will lead to many a funeral.","STR_BOWS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"Bows shoot with an arcing trajectory, which makes them very useful in dense terrain (but not in the forest, where the tree canopies are a major issue).{NEWLINE}The Throwing skill commands both accuracy and a large part of bow damage, so don't expect good results from anyone with Throwing below 50; however, experienced soldiers can inflict fairly heavy damage using bows. High Stamina is also essential for an archer, since the larger bows put a major drain on it.{NEWLINE}Bows don't get any accuracy bonus from kneeling, and shooting them costs a fixed amount of TUs, so make use of your mobility.{NEWLINE}Arrows often inflict less damage to enemy Health than expected, so don't rely on them in 1 vs 1 situations.","STR_PISTOLS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}The main advantage of pistols is that they suffer no accuracy penalty when your other hand is occupied. They're also fairly accurate, shoot very fast and fit the quickdraw (QD) slot. Pistols also suffer the least when being fired in melee combat (over 100% CQ Accuracy). The main disadvantages are: limited accurate range, lowish damage and reduced accuracy bonus from kneeling (just +10%).{NEWLINE}We now understand how cased ammunition works and we'll be able to reproduce it, once we have a proper Workshop.","STR_SHOTGUNS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}Shotguns have the highest close-range accuracy of all guns, although their accurate range is severely limited. They usually fire pellet munitions which have huge damage potential, but are completely useless against armored targets.{NEWLINE}Shotguns are best used in close quarters combat, where they almost guarantee a one-shot-kill against ordinary enemies; their CQ accuracy is similar to rifles' 90%. Watch out for their notoriously slow reload.","STR_SMGS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Two-handed SMGs and, partially, Carbines fall under this category. These weapons have higher volume of fire than Rifles, as well as faster aiming, usually allowing them to fire two aimed shots per turn. They often have reduced single-handed use penalty (per gun description), and can be fired in melee at 90-100% accuracy. Thus they're particularly good at delivering high amounts of pain at medium ranges.","STR_RIFLES_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"Rifles are the most average weapons of all, and most dependable, even if they don't shine in any single aspect. All rifles have two general advantages:{NEWLINE}> Unlimited Aimed Shot range;{NEWLINE}> 15% Armor Penetration with Piercing munitions (Firearms only). This does include machineguns and sniper rifles (but not chainguns), as long as they don't get any bonus damage based on soldier's stats (Rifles that get such a bonus are excluded as well).","STR_SNIPER_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The most common characteristics among these weapons are slow firing rates and a serious influence of shooter's skill on the damage inflicted. This means potential damage far exceeding that of normal rifles. 'True' sniper rifles are governed by Firing^2 * 0.01 skill, making them almost useless for warriors of Firing below circa 75. Rifles governed by this formula also inflict more dependable damage (2 * 0-100% instead of 0-200%)","STR_HEAVY_WEAPONS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"Heavy weapons are not simply heavy, but they often require forethought to use properly. When planning to use one, be sure to check if you're strong enough, if the weapon doesn't get a major accuracy bonus when used from a kneeling position, if it requires offhand to be free (a red '2' in Inventory) and how punishing are TU costs of its attacks. Also it is generally unadvised to fire them in melee.{NEWLINE}A study of how these are built seems crucial to making our own heavy weapons.","STR_EXPLOSIVES_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"Explosives never fail to provide fun. If exploded directly on someone, they attack the under armor, which is usually the thinnest; they also do quad damage vs. large units. Blast usually weakens by 10 per tile, but eg. Fire inflicts full damage within the whole area.{NEWLINE}>Launched. These use some kind of a launcher and explode on contact.{NEWLINE}>Thrown. Much like the former but require no launcher.{NEWLINE}>Fused. They explode after a set number of half-turns (0 is after your current turn, 1 is after the next enemy turn, 2 is after your next turn etc). Prime, then Throw or drop.{NEWLINE}>Proximity. When primed, they explode when a target enters or leaves a 1-tile radius.","STR_MAGITECH_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"Magitech is sophisticated equipment, amplifying one's VooDoo powers; the Stellar Empire has known it for so long that this technology can be found in endless applications. This knowledge is essential for our development of said equipment.{NEWLINE}Contrary to popular opinion, the mage is rarely the main source of power; her relevant mental skills (V.Power and V.Skill, but sometimes also Bravery and others) rather, allow using an instrument's power to lesser or greater extent, and everyone has a V.Power rating, even if it's hidden (not evaluated).","STR_AMMO_ARCANE_UFOPEDIA":"Academy Provost's knowledge allowed us to devise munitions brimming with arcane powers. They ignore half of enemy's armor, rarely underperform, and inflict triple stun damage. They have a devastating morale effect, too. Their power is augmented by user's VooDoo Power (*0.1 per each 7 base damage). Be careful, though, if your intention is capture instead of horrible death - Arcane Rounds do inflict Fatal Wounds and their victims need to be healed to survive. Arcane Rounds require Hypno Panels to manufacture.","STR_AMMO_MANUFACTURING_1_UFOPEDIA":"This is the workshop reportin', Cap'n! Don't mind all these explosives lying around, will ya? We're just starting to figure out what to do with'em ourselves. Anyways, using these to produce pistol bullets seems easy enough, and we'll be able to replenish our supplies without paying those sharks at the marketplace! Just keep us supplied with Chemicals and Scrap Metal. Workshop out!","STR_AMMO_MANUFACTURING_2_UFOPEDIA":"We're getting a knack! Figuring out how to produce standard bullets for rifles took us some time, but we've finally nailed it. However, replicating AP rounds here is too much hassle to be worth it. Just first, these bitches from the Lab need to tell us the specifics of a weapon the ammo is for!","STR_AMMO_MANUFACTURING_3_UFOPEDIA":"Firearms are said to be underpowered, compared to more advanced weaponry. This is not necessarily true. We're ready to start designing some extremely powerful models, based on old Earth blueprints. The time for big game hunting is on.","STR_CANNONS_MANUFACTURING_1_UFOPEDIA":"If a rifle is pretty decent at killing people, then a hand-held cannon is inherently better. The problem was, such weapons tend to blow up in the face if shoddily made. But no more; we can finally start working on new weapons, unrestrained with bothersome things like caliber.","STR_MUTANT_GUNS_UFOPEDIA":"We were thinkin', Cap'n - that's what you're paying us for, 'fter all. And we thought, since them Gals are much stronger than humans, why should we be using human weapons? Sure, better science better gives firepower, but increasing the size of a simpler gun should increase the raw power in equal amount.","STR_SHOOTA_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"The basic idea of guns made especially for us caught on, and now we followed up with even bigger calibres and ammo counts. We can now produce all-piratey shooty things like Handcannons and Boarding Guns!","STR_SLUGGA_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"To get even more damage out of home-made firearms, we can sacrifice their accurate range. Massive, but low-velocity slugs cause tremendous carnage, while keeping the recoil bearable.","STR_ACIDIC_AMMO_UFOPEDIA":"Every hand knows that there are three general ways to defeat carapace armor: hi-powered lasers, high explosives and a cutlass wielded by a brave, yet not necessarily smart, warrior. Each way has its own shortcomings. However, we have discovered that the commonly used carapace has a certain weakness: chem. Being earthlings, and thus particularly ingenious at killing stuff, we have designed a few types of chemic ammo to exploit that weakness.","STR_EXPLOSIVE_AMMO_UFOPEDIA":"With the capabilities to home-manufacture explosive shells, we can start to blow things up with reckless abandon. Not like we have to. But it has been a hard and pebbly road up to this point, so why not celebrate some. Everyone likes fireworks, right?","STR_STUN_BOMB_PRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"We have finally mastered - well, sort of - the secret of the Stellar Empire Stun Bombs. Turns out they use the same strange magic as the Hypno Panels and shares some of the construction with the Mind Probe. Taken together, we can readily manufacture more of these wondrous VIP-catching bombs, as long as we can secure a supply of Hypno Panels.","STR_LASER_AMMO_UFOPEDIA":"Now we can construct ammo clips fitting all commonly-used laser weapons, using superconductive loops as energy capacitors. These won't be as powerful or capacious as Nuclear-based clips, but still pretty close - and much cheaper. However, to charge these clips, we need higher energy density than available in our grid, so we need to build a dedicated power station.","STR_LASER_AMMO_NUCLEAR_UFOPEDIA":"With this technology we know how to replicate nuclear-based laser weapon clips, just like those commonly found on the battlefield. However, the knowledge alone is not enough, and we need an Industrial Printer facility operating at a Hideout to be able to do so.","STR_LASER_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA":"To start constructing our own laser weapons, it was necessary to learn how they're built. Now we can disassemble these lasers into components, which can be more efficiently stored, and out of which new laser weapons can be built.{NEWLINE}Lasers can be broken down into 4 main components: Energy Weapon Parts, Laser Lenses, Focusing Crystals and Heavy Power Couplings. Here's the breakdown of how many parts various types and sizes contain:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Small: 1/1/0/0                      Sub: 2/2/0/0{NEWLINE}Standard: 2/1/1/0                 Large: 3/1/2/1{NEWLINE}Large Auto: 3/3/1/1               X-Large: 4/2/2/2{NEWLINE}X-Large Auto: 5/4/3/2            Small Craft: 10/4/4/2{NEWLINE}Large Craft: 20/8/8/4","STR_GAUSS_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA":"As with the Laser weapons before, we've learned how to disassemble Gauss weapons now.{NEWLINE}They can be broken down into 4 main components: Energy Weapon Parts, Gauss Coils, Energy Capacitors and Heavy Power Couplings. Here's the breakdown of how many parts various types and sizes contain:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Small: 1/1/0/0                      Sub: 1/2/0/0{NEWLINE}Standard: 2/1/1/0                 Large: 3/2/2/0{NEWLINE}Large Auto: 3/3/1/1               X-Large: 4/2/4/1{NEWLINE}X-Large Auto: 5/4/3/1            Small Craft: 10/4/4/2{NEWLINE}Large Craft: 20/8/8/4","STR_PLASMA_DISASSEMBLY_UFOPEDIA":"Per analogiam with less advanced weapons, we have figured out how to disassemble Plasma Weapons - which doesn't mean we know how to use them or how they work.{NEWLINE}Plasma weapons can be broken down into 4 main components: Energy Weapon Parts, Plasma Chambers, Inertial Accelerators, Heavy Power Couplings and what we call Magischen-Motors. Here's the breakdown of how many parts various types and sizes contain:{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Small: 1/1/0/0/1                     Sub: 2/2/0/0/1{NEWLINE}Standard: 2/1/1/0/1                 Large: 3/1/2/1/1{NEWLINE}X-Large: 4/2/2/2/1               Small Craft: 10/4/4/2/2{NEWLINE}Large Craft: 20/8/8/4/2","STR_LASER_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA":"As is often the case, putting laser guns together turned out to be a little more challenging than taking them apart. Most of them are too complex to even bother, and we need to know more to construct standardized clips for them. The simpler ones we can make, though.","STR_PARTICLE_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA":"It seems that the Plasma Weapons used by the Stellar Empire are just an advanced application of a technology known also by the name of Fusion Guns. Even these are too advanced for us, but we still can employ their basic physical principles to be able to blast enemies with Plasma, especially since we don't mind Hellerium radiation that is sure as hell to leak out. We expect good accuracy and hefty, dependable damage, but power loss over distance is unavoidable without Magnetic Containment mastery.{NEWLINE}We'll need a Printer to manufacture these.","STR_GAUSS_CANNON_AMMO_PROD_UFOPEDIA":"Gauss cannons sure are potent, but we've lacked a way to reproduce their ammo, thus being reduced to scavenging. Not any more - through luck, trial and error, we've reproduced the required Plastasteel forging process.","STR_RAIL_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA":"While the mystery of how the Gauss weapons really work remains unbroken, we have devised a simpler way of launching magnetic projectiles: a linear accelerator. We need Gauss Defenses present at a Hideout to manufacture these weapons.","STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA":"We have mastered the art of manufacturing plasma weapons and their ammunition, as long as we erect an Industrial Printer and a Fusion Reactor. While very expensive to maintain, these weapons are unmatched in killing power.","STR_NUCLEAR_LASERS_UFOPEDIA":"After some more R&R, uh, I mean, R&D, we're ready to start designing custom nuclear laser designs. Good-bye ammo dependency, hello unrestrained firepower.{NEWLINE}Regarding disassembly of Nuclear Lasers, you will get the same amounts of parts as from normal lasers. You will also retrieve all Plastasteel used in the production.","STR_NUCLEAR_GAUSS_AMMO_UFOPEDIA":"We have learned the secrets of manufacturing the Stellar Empire's Gauss ammunition. The technology entails using an Industrial Printer to create a lattice of Plastasteel, laced with Hellerium clusters for efficient energy storage and release.","STR_PLASTASTEEL_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA":"Using plastasteel in conventional munitions manufacturing is expensive, but yields some improvements. By replacing the bullet mantle we can achieve higher damage, without losing FMJ's ammo 15% armor piercing qualities. The clips can be made thinner, increasing the capacity by approximately one-fifth. However, this technology is practical only for high-velocity weapons, like rifles or machine guns.","STR_EP_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA":"Using Superconductive Wire to hold a potent energy charge inside a bullet's tip, it is possible to manufacture so-called Pulse munitions. While expensive, such bullets cause horrible electrical burns and cause quad stun damage (ignoring Shock Immunity).","STR_MAG_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA":"Instead of expending effort in trying to develop full-fledged rail weapons, we drew inspiration from the Rail Driver and prepared self-propelling magnetic munitions that can be fired from sufficiently robust firearms. As the ammo needs a power source and magnetic coils, the magazine capacity is cut by 40-50%, but the firepower increases by up to a half. The Armor Penetration, if any, is lost, however.","STR_NUCLEAR_MUNITIONS_UFOPEDIA":"You requested more firepower, Cap'n, and we are happy to deliver results. Using minuscule amounts of Hellerium as propellant and Plastasteel for a harder-hitting warhead, we were able to devise more powerful ammunition for selected firearms that can survive the stress of such a discharge. We could warn you that these new munitions are a bit volatile, but the hands are unlikely to listen anyway, so why bother.","STR_ELERIUM_EXPLOSIVES_UFOPEDIA":"Using Hellerium to produce explosives is a very hard trick, but to a degree, we can do that now. In a dirty way. Most of the Hellerium involved is going to turn to fallout, with efficiency close to 10-20 %, as we rely on conventional explosives laced with it. However, if all you need is a good bang, there is no reason to complain.","STR_FUSION_EXPLOSIVES_UFOPEDIA":"Through studying various weapon designs and containment fields, we believe we have reached the level of understanding of Hellerium's chemistry required to unleash its full destructive force in a safe manner. More or less. To the point, we have designs for new rockets and grenades you're going to like. What you're not going to like is the fact that we need a Fusion Reactor to manufacture them.","STR_ATOM_POWER_UFOPEDIA":"Indeed, we now have some understanding of how nuclear fission - that is, splitting of atoms - works. Still we have no idea why the Star Gods are so iffed at this technology. Maybe it's because it doesn't use their Hellerium, but something much less... nice. For now, we have figured out how to make this and that, but the topic is challenging. We need a Power Plant and a Refinery present at a Hideout to effect any atom-related manufacturing.","STR_ELECTRICS_UFOPEDIA":"We have studied the underlying principles of Force Circuitry. We have blown up a whole lot of them, but we devised how they can be used to generate all sorts of powerful discharges, like unstable forcefields that'd improve our melee weaponry. There seems to be much more to the Force Circuitry than meets the eye, that is, than refractors and holograms. Researching power- and material-related technology, as well as interrogating enemy leaders seem to be the keys to progressing further.","STR_POWER_SOURCE_TWEAKING_UFOPEDIA":"Turns out that, unsurprisingly, careful tweaking of a ship's engine to a specific airframe allows us to achieve greater performance than simply putting random engines onto it. All that and more is possible once we understood that invisible, but tangible forces that motivate such vehicles are streams of certain tiny particles of matter/energy.","STR_SELF_REPAIRING_HULL_UFOPEDIA":"Ship hulls and other components are made of separate cells, which can regenerate when provided energy and raw material. Molecules are transported via carbon nanotubes and plastasteel crystal grows to repair damage or wear. Now we can design ships with a properly working regeneration system.","STR_FIGHTER_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"Developing our own fighter beyond the clunky H/K seemed like an impossibility, until we got schematics of a working, commercial ship and found out that, in fact, the body plan of Imperial ships is stupidly easy, the only problem being hi-tech components that must be salvaged (and studied), as they're impossible to reproduce.","STR_MINI_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA":"High-performance engines burn Hellerium to dust, but it is also known that the isotope can be used as power storage by carefully depleting most of the power contained in it. The energy density is much lower, but such an arrangement can be recharged. The process is very tricky but can be used to create things like powered armor.","STR_OPTRONICS_UFOPEDIA":"All the computation in Empire technology is based on so-called Optronics, or optical processing, as well as mind-boggling algorithms devised by the Star Gods. It is somewhat analogous, though, to Old Earth's Electronics that we learned about. While internal workings of these devices are extremely complex and trying to understand them is a forlorn effort, all we really needed to coerce them to do our bidding was to gather enough practical knowledge of their language and a body of suitable, stolen programs to do calculations for us, while getting rid of parts and software that takes years of training to be used.","STR_DATA_ENCRYPTION_UFOPEDIA":"When it comes to computer code, the Star Gods are truly worthy of their title. Their encryption software is unbreakable, and their compression algorithms approach average 99% size reduction on large amounts of data, making interstellar communications much easier and allowing them to keep entire personas stored digitally on relatively small Optronic crystal matrices. The math involved is truly beyond human understanding, but we have procured a selection of maintenance tools and backdoors to penetrate their locks, and exclusive software that could allow us to run powerful data centres of our own.","STR_PBA_TRAINING_UFOPEDIA":"The gals aren't used to interacting with machinery that invades their privacy too much, like heavy armored suits or cybernetics. Unlike guns, such things are considered evil magics. However, to advance further, learning to live close to machines is unavoidable. We have prepared a special course to hopefully defeat superstition in that area.","STR_CYBERNETIC_INTERFACE_UFOPEDIA":"With a command interface which pre-processes all input and uses sophisticated holo displays, an operator can react much faster and with more precision than when she's handling some buttons and levers. This leads to more hacking fun, as well as better flying armors and fighters.","STR_MIND_MACHINE_INTERFACE_UFOPEDIA":"The pinnacle of command interface is a machine that becomes one with the operator - she hears, sees and feels everything the machine does, and can command it with a mere thought. Not only does it allow improved performance, but is also elegant and space-saving.","STR_SMART_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA":"We have pursued an exciting path of experimentation - tweaking salvaged Slave AIs to command autonomous weapons systems! No, this doesn't mean we can immediately start to manufacture killer robots, at least until a suitable chassis appears. A less ambitious, but more promising approach is putting Slave AIs into handheld weapons, getting a real-life auto-aim!","STR_HYPERWAVES_UFOPEDIA":"Hyperwaves is what these smart engineer types are calling the invisible and intangible medium of instantaneous communications. We can use this knowledge to develop a facility dedicated to decoding vessel transmissions and transponders, which means not only instant detection, but also info on who's flying the shipping, its type and mission. However, this means tons of cryptographic work, so the results aren't likely to appear soon.","STR_FORCEFIELDS_UFOPEDIA":"With the information procured from a Reverend, we were finally able to break the mystery of the Church's energy fields. They're able to project or dissipate all sorts of energies, making them useful in both attack and defense. As it turns out, they're just a partial implementation of ship-mounted shields of the Stellar Empire. Such real shields regenerate fast (usually .25% per second), but require bulky machinery. However I think we can devise some simpler, hybrid shields for our own ships, lacking that sort of regeneration, but small enough for their frames. To regenerate them, our ship would have to spend 1 hour undergoing maintenance.","STR_STARGOD_SHIELDS_UFOPEDIA":"Quite unsurprisingly, the Star Gods know a lot about making shields, and the shields they're using on their own ships are quite on a different level than the cheap knockoffs the Church is tinkering with. Not only are Star God shields more efficient, they have devised a number of support technologies to further enhance their potency. Most of the physics involved is far too arcane to understand, much less learned from an interrogation, but I think we have gained the understanding of at least one useful bit; with enough technological base of our own, we'll be able to devise shield recharging systems small enough to fit our miniature craft.","STR_SUBSPACE_UFOPEDIA":"To actually travel through a 'Black Hole', instead of being destroyed by it, Star God vessels enter a sort of a parallel dimension, called 'Subspace'. It is said to somehow exist outside of normal spacetime, and thus allows far greater speeds than normal warping. On the downside, you cannot enter it without a pair of 'Jump Gates', each utilizing a 'Black Hole'.","STR_GRAVITY_PHYSICS_UFOPEDIA":"The Stellar Empire has mastered the use of antigravity, as can be witnessed in the easiness of use of the Grav Harness and antigrav vehicles. The body of knowledge we have secured will let us optimize our own antigravitic technologies.","STR_TRACTORS_AND_REPULSORS_UFOPEDIA":"An important technological secret of the Stellar Empire, Tractor and Repulsor Beams are used to either pull or push mass without any physical contact, often at large ranges and stupendous scales. The mechanism somehow involves Hyperwave and Gravitic Physics. In a more mundane form, we know it from commonly available Lifters. We're quite sure that with enough base knowledge, we'll be able to replicate this technology for our own, nefarious needs.","STR_PHASE_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA":"Perhaps the most exotic and arcane of Star God technologies, it is based on the strange 'phase-shift' effect, where something can exist in our reality, but yet, not quite so. When applied to individuals, a phase shield can make them invisible and intangible to most weapons, while perfectly able to shoot back. It still cannot fool motion scanners or psionic detection, though. When applied to a craft, the results are less spectacular, effectively amounting to a major boost of shield strength.","STR_NEURAL_SCANNER_UFOPEDIA":"A closely guarded secret of the Star Gods, this sophisticated device is able to read, write and erase the contents of one's mind. The Stellar Empire uses it for intelligence purposes, as well as to imprint skills, knowledge and loyalty upon their freshly-bred clone soldiers.{NEWLINE}However, the Scanner has its limitations. Every mind, especially a natural-born one, has its unique internal language of great complexity, making any deeper tampering difficult, imperfect and damaging.{NEWLINE}The much less potent, portable version of the Scanner is known as the Mind Probe.","STR_SENSOSPHERE_UFOPEDIA":"A device used mainly by the Star Gods' clients. The recipient is levitated inside a sphere, which can both read and stimulate their nerves, while being fully opaque from inside, and sound-proof, thus creating an inescapable virtual reality if needed. If desired, the observers can feel the experience directly through arcane linkage. The device has a wide range of uses, from punishment and interrogation to training to pleasuring oneself.","STR_GAUSS_UNLOCK_UFOPEDIA":"We finally found the tools to break, or rather circumvent, the codes blocking Gauss Weapons. We can now freely use them.","STR_PSI_UNLOCK_UFOPEDIA":"It turned out that the Stellar Empire's weapons - like Plasma guns - operate on pure magic. I mean, not exactly operate, but to use or otherwise tamper with them, one needs to bond with the weapon on a magical level. Actual sorcery is not needed, anyone can be trained... even if in some cases, it's a long and sad process. To the point - now we can operate said weapons, or take them apart to learn their secrets.","STR_KULTUR_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}We choose to be Pirates, and confront reality with our ideals. So what makes a Pirate here and now?{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>VIOLENCE. Hard to argue with the 'if it doesn't work for you, you are not using it enough' principle.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>CUNNING. Because working harder is less profitable than working smarter, especially when it's others who do the work for us.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>SURVIVAL. Because look at us - we be, like, top of the food pyramid!{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}>WEIRDNESS. Who are we? Why are we here? Then you start asking questions like 'How can I live better?', and finally you get to 'How can I rule the world?'.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}These are the four cornerstones of our Pirate Culture. All are important, but we can pursue only one at a time, so tell us what you want us to do next!","STR_PIRATE_LIFE_UFOPEDIA":"We gals here be from different parts of the world, but since we got into this weird protection scheme with the Govts, and will all live together from now on, we must set some common goals to avoid stabbing each other too much! Our Idea - let's become Pirates! Have adventures in style, show disdain for private property, and get as rich as possible!","STR_PARTY_UFOPEDIA":"Aye, 'twas some fun we had, celebrating our newfound identity... Honestly I don't remember much of it, but if it was any more wild, I guess the word 'orgy' would be more fitting... Anyway, I heard our excesses already became famous in the area, which will likely help us with impressing certain groups...{NEWLINE}(250 points awarded.)","STR_JACKSTOWN_UFOPEDIA":"Ruled by the flamboyant leader of the Lokk'Naar's, 'Captain' Jack, this is the place where we can do most of our Black Market business. The prices are outrageous, but the town has powerful and numerous militia, plus, we won't find better prices in any Black Market trading town, so there's no choice but to play along.{NEWLINE}[More buyables & info unlocked]","STR_CONTACT_BLACK_MARKET_UFOPEDIA":"A few miles away from our Hideout, there yonder lives the Lokk'Naar Tribe. This group of short, long-eared mutants controls a nearby trading post, where all flotsam and jetsam from neighboring lands drifts to, greeted by a welcome sign 'the past is dead, the present is overrated'. Since such places daily witness all sorts of weird deals and illicit services, it's perfect for us to get supplies, sell loot, have some fun and find people for any job, from facility builders to fighting crew. There are innumerable places like this, places of gatherings, situated on various crossroads the powers that be are unable or unwilling to control. All these hand-to-mouth mutant communities form a loose network all around the globe, called the Black Market - a vast, unruly, and uncontrollable entity, full of chancers, misfits and outcasts just like us.","STR_CONTACT_MUTANT_ALLIANCE_UFOPEDIA":"We have been approached by representatives of the so-called Mutant Alliance: a loose organisation with global reach which claims to represent the rights of all mutants (especially the poor and forsaken). With all their talk about political pressure and moderate resistance, these self-proclaimed mutant representatives seem a bit fishy (likely to sell out their allies if they cease to be useful, if you ask me), but they have a share of power in every Provincial Govt on the planet, and came to us bearing gifts, some useful, some less so: influencing the govts in our favor (+1500 Infamy), free textbooks and access to their underground network of supplies.{NEWLINE}As for the price, they expect us to help fighting off the Mutant Pogroms. We will be informed of more Pogroms, and if we don't provide at least a token presence, it will cost us 1000 Infamy each time.","STR_CONTACT_DEALERS_UFOPEDIA":"Buying stuff that is accessible only for upstanding human citizens isn't easy for those who tread the path of glory, but we managed to win essential contacts, allowing us to get that stuff through various middlemen.","STR_CONTACT_KRAZY_HANNA_UFOPEDIA":"This mutant lady sells military hardware, and, frankly speaking, seems to be obsessed with all things mechanical. Understandably, getting to her wasn't easy and involved some run-ins with her security droids.","STR_CONTACT_GUN_EMPORIUM_UFOPEDIA":"Our unabating interest in various gun designs led us to these dealers, who supply a wild selection of rarer models. Some of these guns need to be found and researched, some are available straight away.","STR_CONTACT_GENERAL_SUPPLIES_UFOPEDIA":"We have convinced the merchants of Jack's Town that we can be trusted, to some degree. Now they will sell us a wider selection of warez, including these required to develop more advanced facilities. To expand the selection of available weapons, research ones looted from the enemy. Note that only the most common weapons will become buyable through this Contact.","STR_CONTACT_CAR_THIEVES_UFOPEDIA":"To really get out of this hole and move freely around the whole planet, we need a supply of flying machines. Contacting thieves of mildly restricted, battery-powered craft came easy, as Jack's people operate a tuning shop for such used vehicles. Apart from getting fabulously drunk while dealing with them, we've also learned that to get access to Hellerium-fired craft, we need to get to the so-called Authorized Dealers (just a higher tier of thieves), but that requires better contacts within the financial sector, and the knowledge of Social Hierarchy. We can also try our luck with the Ship Junkyard, who can help us with constructing our own craft. However, we need to learn their comm frequencies and certain tech-savvyness to be able to talk to them.","STR_CONTACT_BUILDERS_UFOPEDIA":"The denizens of the local Builder's Hall can give us some pointers on to how construct various facilities, including real Workshops.{NEWLINE}External workers can also help us with storage problems; each hired Worker expands our storage space by 4, but takes 5,000 Dolaros in monthly pay. However, they deliver an instantaneous storage capacity boost, without the need to wait for any Vaults to be built.{NEWLINE}The Builders can also help us to coerce some of the landlubbers we catch to do some honest work, if you have such a fancy, Cap'n; the boon will be experience sharing. 'Job Interviews' are titled 'Hire:' under Workshop's 'Interrogation' tab. Yes, we'll have to pay them, once their 'trial period' ends.","STR_CONTACT_SHIP_JUNKYARD_UFOPEDIA":"Getting to people who deal in used ship parts wasn't easy, but we've not only secured a supply of some restricted parts, we also have access to tools which will allow us to construct our own crafts. Note that some crafts burn expensive Hellerium.","STR_CONTACT_SMUGGLERS_UFOPEDIA":"The Smugglers will provide us with exotic goods from all over the Galaxy, from weapons for our Hands, to high-quality junk our Brainers can tinker with.","STR_CONTACT_MAGIC_SHOP_UFOPEDIA":"Knowing VooDoo means little if we have no tools to use it. Our investigations in various shady, nocturnal locales netted us an invitation into this obscure establishment, dealing in arcane items.","STR_CONTACT_MERCENARIES_UFOPEDIA":"After some preliminary talks, the Mercenaries have shown willingness to sign job contracts with us - as long as we have the money, they don't ask questions. A lot of money, since, with who we are, we're unlikely to get prime prices.{NEWLINE}[We can now order kidnappings on the Black Market]","STR_CONTACT_FUSO_UFOPEDIA":"Fuso! The land of Ninjas and Samurai! When we made a ruckus at the Black Market, they agreed to supply us with iconic Fuso weapons.","STR_CONTACT_EUROSYNDICATE_UFOPEDIA":"The arms dealers of the Eurosyndicate have shown interest in our money. They offer us two very potent, if very expensive, laser weapons. They're willing to trade us some even better ones, if we agree to strike a cooperation deal with them - which will likely entail doing some very dirty work. Let's hope we really have what it takes if we don't want to end up as mere scapegoats.","STR_MISSION_EUROSYNDICATE_DEAL_UFOPEDIA":"HIGHER EUROSYNDICATE CLEARANCE CONFIRMED.

Everyone loves Death Games!","STR_CONTACT_DR_WANG_UFOPEDIA":"This Singapore-located shop, run by a self-styled 'Chinese God of Death' has a selection of unique launchers and munitions, likely imported from the underground factories of the Central Province.","STR_CONTACT_ROGUE_FIELDS_UFOPEDIA":"Contacting the local 'Lords of War' wasn't easy, but now we have access to some of their piratical weapons, including craft armaments and gasoline-guzzling vehicles.","STR_CONTACT_RETICULANS_UFOPEDIA":"Our... involvement with the Reticulans fruited in their offer to trade. They said, why should we kill each other, if we simply can exchange goods for mutual benefit? They also said the trade should only be the beginning... I can only hope against hope that nothing really uncanny will come out of this, Cap'n...","STR_SOLDIER_M_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA":"Aye, the quality of untrained Hands is often underwhelming. We can now tighten our requirements, but this will also cost us a lot of money: a seasoned Warrior will take $80k initial payment and $10k each month thereafter. What do we get in return?{NEWLINE}>Skills: Better average Firing, Throwing and Melee.{NEWLINE}>Physique: Minimum Stamina, Bravery and Strength at substantially improved levels, allowing to use standardized equipment.{NEWLINE}>Survival Instinct: Slightly better minimum Reactions, Willpower and Health.{NEWLINE}>Armor: Each Warrior brings her own Warrior Armor.","STR_SOLDIER_V_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA":"Our fame and recruiting skill now allows us to recruit Veterans, Uber warriors of renowned skill and combat record. Each Veteran brings her own suit of Tac Armor. However, they're anything but cheap: each costs $400k to recruit and takes $40k basic monthly salary (before rank bonuses). In addition, it takes 2 weeks to recruit them.","STR_LOKNAR_RECRUITMENT_UFOPEDIA":"The Lokk'Naar are plentiful and many of them are willing to join our ranks.

The High Mek Order of the Technocracy has deemed you worthy of our attention. Your progress in controlling information, matter and energy has been classified as relatively impressive. We can provide you with advanced components, as well as mass-produced versions of some of your old inventions. State your requirements.","STR_NO_CIVILIAN_TRAFFIC_UFOPEDIA":"All these Civilian boats flying around were a real nuisance. We have disabled tracking them, and pledged to never attack them again. Well, in a couple of months, there are still a few things to settle... [1000 points awarded].","STR_VIP_KIDNAPPING_UFOPEDIA":"Like it was said, Mercs will do any job, no questions asked. If we have the money. [VIPs buyable now].","STR_ZERO_ZERO_UFOPEDIA":"Our political sway is growing, and some mysterious powers seem to be helping us from behind the scenes... or maybe too many hours of netrunning made me paranoid, Cap'n. But I believe we can approach the Local Govts more directly, and convince them that betraying us would be like killing a golden goose. To do so, we need full knowledge of political activities around the globe, as well as information about Govt high officials.","STR_FAMILY_TIES_UFOPEDIA":"Through the help of certain... friends, and by continuing to be useful, we have reinforced our position within the global structure to the point where no sane local government will brandish the 'Zero Tolerance Policy' against us anymore.","STR_RETICULAN_AND_HUMAN_TECH_UFOPEDIA":"My study leads me to believe there is little direct gain for us here. Any new solutions, would either be sub-par to what we've already scavenged from the Stellar Empire, or impractical to implement without access to manpower and infrastructure on a much grander level that we could possibly ever have. Why would we need fusion-powered equipment if we can buy or scavenge enough Hellerium to cover all our needs? However, the local govts and Reticulans may benefit from this. To help them out, we can start the 'Human-Reticulan Cooperation' project. The downsides are several - first, we need to do this work for free, second, the govts will protect the Reticulans and push some Faction traffic out of business, leading to less loot, third, it might make the govts more dangerous if we cross them... On the other hand, it will weaken the Star Gods and their stooges. Either way, once we complete the project, there will be no going back.","STR_HUMAN_RETICULAN_ALLIANCE_UFOPEDIA":"For good or for bad, it is done. We have helped the Humans and Reticulans to overcome their differences. Everyone's celebrating, but are we really better off? There is already talk about Govts starting to develop powerful fusion-powered vessels and weapons.","STR_NO_AGGRESSION_UFOPEDIA":"We have seen them all - from crazed Humanists to thieving Bandits, from organized death squads to Deep One hordes. Normal people everywhere are brutalized on a daily basis, unless they're the privileged who live within city walls. This aggression can't stand, and we're in position to do something about it - permanently. With your tactical genius, Cap'n, and all the military tech we possess, we can help the Mutant Alliance to form self-defense forces. This will allow them to thwart all Pogroms before they even begin. However,  once we complete the project, our tech will be in rebel hands, and we will have no control over it, nor any way of going back.","STR_MUTANT_SELF_DEFENSE_UFOPEDIA":"It is done. The Mutant Self Defense Forces (MSDF) have been formed, their first deed - blowing up the Solar Courier's HQ and proclaiming they did so in collusion with us. The big factions are upset, to put it mildly. The MSDF (also called 'The Rebels') will fly regular patrols (which will increase our score a bit), which should take care of Mutant Pogroms for good. Watch out for Rebel Fighters (distinguished by yellow and green lights), shooting them down will cost us a lot of nerves later.","STR_RUSSIAN_FILES_STAGED_UFOPEDIA":"We have a very clear idea now where to look for the mysterious, ancient base we heard about from the Guild Rep we interrogated. Some additional scouting is required to pinpoint its location, but we believe we should be ready early next month.","STR_RUSSIAN_FILES_UFOPEDIA":"After learning where to look, we've embarked upon an adventure in Russia. In an underground bunker built centuries ago, audio logs revealed a forgotten story. It seems that when the Earth was invaded by the Stellar Empire, most of the planet surrendered after a few years of struggle, but one country - Russia - fought on for a couple of decades (curiously, nowadays the area is a cornerstone of the Mutant Alliance) and became the last refuge of the so-called X-COM project, a clandestine organisation created back then to pit Earth's best and brightest against the invasion. We've found some technical expertise developed by X-COM, chiefly that of nuclear-powered laser weapons that had practically unlimited energy supply. However, to make heads or tails of this data we need to expand our knowledge base in the areas of nuclear weaponry and power sources. We must also examine contemporary Laser and Gauss weapons before attempting to develop laser guns based on X-COM expertise.","STR_CLOAKING_DEVICE_INVESTIGATION_UFOPEDIA":"There's a great mystery behind one device so crucial to our success - the Cloaking Device. We've found no clue about them in the course of our adventures, they seem to be uniquely available to our Black Market suppliers. Scouring the network yielded little results besides the mentions of such technology being somehow linked to the mythical 'Shadowmasters' - a force which supposedly gifts people on various planets with artifacts of unknown origin, always with some detrimental results to the Star Gods. Having no other recourse, we've forced some Lokk'Naar merchants to talk (-200 score); to our chagrin, they knew very little themselves - the Cloaking Devices are being given to them at secret dropoff points, coordinates being sent to them by unknown benefactors. Elusive and secretive, just like our Well-Wisher...","STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA":"The society of Earth can be broken down into three distinct groups. The first group are the so-called factions: The Academy, The Traders, The Church and The Mercenaries. They cooperate with the Star Gods directly and are given exclusive right to travel freely around the globe. The second group are local, or provincial, governments, the people who pay us the protection money. They're not very happy with their limited power, and the existence of pirates like us is beneficial to them, as it undermines the dominance of the global factions. But if we attack their ships and officers directly, it won't be popular. On the other hand, getting our hands on their stuff has its obvious, immediate benefits. The third group are the poor masses, on whom the Mutant Alliance is based - an influential force within the local governments, a 'civil' face of the opposition towards the rule of the Star Gods, and also our allies of convenience... as long as we're convenient to them. Finally the Star Gods themselves sometimes do make an appearance on our planet. The wise avoid them at any cost. Good thing we aren't wise, Cap'n!","STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA":"The rumors are confirmed now - the Stellar Empire governor of the Solar System resides on Mars, in the Cydonia region. He (she/it) rarely directly influences the happenings on Earth, preferring to let the humans and mutants police themselves... unless something goes out of control. The governor's residence is guarded by multiple layers of orbital defenses, but it seems that the VIPs of each faction possess security passes. However, each faction possesses only a code to a single layer of defense, corresponding to their facilities on Mars. To get to the governor, one would need to get hold of all the passes.","STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST_UFOPEDIA":"It is now clear that there is only so much we can do on Earth. No matter how much money, vessels, soldiers or political influence we have, we're always going to be just a pirate gang down here. Sure, it isn't a bad life now, we're rich, feared and respected. But maybe you have your eyes on something bigger, Cap'n? Earth's factions will always have immensely more resources than we do, and they will never let us into their elite club. But if we did the impossible and prepared a direct strike against the Solar Governor, we could - only theoretically - hijack its control network and climb to a different level altogether. If you're bold enough, here's the checklist: first of all, security codes procured from an Academy's Provost, Trader Guildmaster, Church Cardinal and, well Star God Coordinator (some of those might require indepth interrogation). Secondly, a big space ship to take us to Mars, which means top-tier shipbuilding and life support systems expertise. It is a short list, true. But it goes without saying that we have only a single chance to do this. If we attempt and fail, the Governor will immediately destroy us.","STR_SAT_NETWORK_UFOPEDIA":"It is apparent that the Earth is enveloped in several layers of comm satellites, some of them new, some of them many centuries old. With the knowledge of Slave AIs and Hyperwaves we can communicate with them, but gaining any meaningful info would require more research into the matter. The older satellites seem like a perfect backdoor, but even those require access codes, and while we can probably forge the codes, we can't conjure them from thin air.","STR_BASIC_ELECTRONICS_UFOPEDIA":"The software, or code, used by commercially available computers is a real jungle that takes a lot of braining to even begin to understand. No doubt there was a lot of malicious intent behind this. We'll need to obtain secret information from world communication networks to make progress there. For now, however, we can simply sidestep this whole mess by working directly on electric parts, slapping them together in various combinations and measuring what voltage goes where.","STR_DATA_MINING_UFOPEDIA":"The personal databases we find contain scraps of useful knowledge. We can squeeze it out, but that will require a lot of databases and many long, sweaty nights of work.","STR_GOVT_HACKING_UFOPEDIA":"We have developed a procedure allowing us to access personal data files through the Sat Network. It requires gathering enough human ID cards and manufacturing a Govt Personal Code, then finishing the procedure here by researching it. Excess codes can be sold for a reasonable price. Sadly, only Govt and lower level Pureblood files can be accessed this way - the global factions, nevermind the Star Gods, have too powerful firewalls.","STR_NAZI_HACKING_UFOPEDIA":"With our improved netrunning skills and gear, we can now hack the elusive Humanists for any secret info they might be keeping, although it will cost us more resources than hacking the Govts.","STR_BABY_NUKE_BLUEPRINTS_UFOPEDIA":"It appears that the humans were once in possession of fabled weapons of mass destruction, able to destroy whole cities. They manufactured these weapons from a rare earth element, called 'Uranium'. Tragically, it seems that this exciting technology has been lost forever, and the Star Gods made sure the existing fission weapons stockpiles disappeared. The 'Baby Nukes' we've found are amongst the last of their kind, and their replication seems impossible.","STR_SAKURA_BLUEPRINTS_UFOPEDIA":"These parchments contain a selection of cooking recipes, supposedly written by the Demonic Goddess of Love, the Purple Flower, herself. They range from nice and practical meals to sweet and delicious cakes that, as the Goddess insists, should not only be tasted, but eaten to the last crumb. The rest of the writings contains creepy musings, healing concoctions, and assorted stuff of downright gruesome kind.","STR_TINY_DRILL_UFOPEDIA":"We finally found some time to poke around the 'Menacing Hull', as you call it. We took the funny drill with us, and... well... The drill seems to be a control part of sorts, or a missing piece of Hull's mechanism we dubbed 'the egg'. When we put it in, the whole machine came to life. There are four insertion ports, which will activate different machine-magics when plugged; however, once the egg is one with the drill, there will be no turning back - the Hull will spend its energies to awaken some properties at the cost of destroying others. What properties? It is beyond our comprehension now, but a 'Codex' that will be produced by the joining will contain the whole knowledge; you can check what we expect of each of them in the 'Treasure' section. Each Codex, among other things, will give us knowledge on how to turn the Hull into a special ship (but to have full understanding of it, we'll need to interrogate a pilot, make test flights, learn basic ship construction and reach certain education level).","STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA":"Plastasteel is a composite of crystalline steel and carbon nano-fibres, very durable and flexible. It is commonly used for heavy-duty construction. We have developed tools to craft it into more intricate shapes than plain sheets. This should allow us to develop things like better craft hulls and improved personal armor. In the future. When we have access to something more than second-hand goods. Not yet.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 4,500.","STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA":"Nuclear fuel, known to the wise under an arcane name of Isotope 511, is used to power all advanced technology of the Star Gods Empire, like space vessels or energy weapons. While we Earthlings do not know their inner workings, the entire society of Empire-ruled Earth depends on their use. Try to seize your prey while landed to assure securing it.{NEWLINE}Hellerium, especially in the form of fallout, is also important for many creatures, including us, which have learned to metabolize it and thus break normal constraints of physiology. Hellerium is said to naturally occur on some extrasolar planets.{NEWLINE}>Sell value: 12k.","STR_ALIEN_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA":"These nuclear grenades are secured by a simple electronic lock. By employing a Slave AI, we were able to break the code quite easily and now we can use these grenades at will - they pack quite a punch for their small size.{NEWLINE}Accuracy: 75%","STR_SMALL_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA":"It took us a lot of work to break the genetic lock that disallowed the weapon to be used by those it was not intended for, eg. us. The weapon itself is curious enough, as it uses anti-gravity to launch special Stun Bombs that are an even greater mystery, as attempts to figure out how they work or even to retro-engineer them failed so far - certainly they don't use any gas. Stun Bombs ignore 25% armor.{NEWLINE}Aimed Shot Accurate Range Cap (20){NEWLINE}Less 1-H Penalty (10%)","STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA":"The Stellar Empire plasma weapons are very compact and lack any real trigger or sights. It is magic, baby, and you need to give this pistol a nice rub and a few caring words to get it to shoot. But when it does, it hits hard, quick and with exceptional accuracy.{NEWLINE}Increased accurate ranges (Auto 14, Snap 18){NEWLINE}Aimed Shot Accurate Range Cap (25)","STR_ELITE_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA":"An intricately crafted version of Stellar Empire plasma pistol, plated with Plastagold.

It is often found in the hands of those unworthy to be trusted with better Plasma weapons.{NEWLINE}Increased Snap Shot accurate range (18){NEWLINE}Less 1-H Penalty (30%)","STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA":"This is a devastatingly powerful weapon based on accelerating particles from within a minute anti-gravity field.

Don't they ever innovate?{NEWLINE}Increased accurate ranges (Auto 14, Snap 18){NEWLINE}Aimed Shot Accurate Range Cap (30)","STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA":"This variation of Stellar Empire plasma gun was built for maximum firepower, and that it delivers in abundance. Still light enough to be wielded by any able person, its only shortcoming compared to the Plasma Rifle is slower rate of fire.{NEWLINE}Increased accurate ranges (Auto 14, Snap 18){NEWLINE}Aimed Shot Accurate Range Cap (25)","STR_PRECISION_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA":"Elite forces' plasma weapon which is insanely difficult to operate due to its sophisticated interface. Once mastered, though, it fully lives up to its name.{NEWLINE}Skill: FIRING^2 * 0.01{NEWLINE}Increased Snap Accurate Range (40)","STR_BLASTER_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA":"Stellar Empire's infantry support weapon. It's better than any other portable launcher, so we call it Bustier Launcher. It fires powerful missiles, guided by YOUR MIND. When you click to fire the weapon it will generate 'way points' for the missile to follow. When you have positioned enough way points click on the special launch icon.{NEWLINE}The missile burns up its mass for fuel as it flies, thus shedding 4 Power for each tile it flies after the 20th. The dispersed Hellerium cloud explosion that follows is extremely good at damaging armor (extra damage = 1/3rd of hit's power){NEWLINE}Slow Reload (20)","STR_CANNONS_MANUFACTURING_2_UFOPEDIA":"There is no easy way to buy craft weapons on the black market - they're strictly regulated. And getting a custom-made weapon onto an airframe is certainly harder than just bolting it to the hull. At least if you want it to work. Long story short, now we can, and nobody can do anything about it. These weapons are called 'light' but remember, that even 50mm cannons are huge compared to personal arms and we better stock up a lot of material if you want to manufacture them.","STR_CANNONS_MANUFACTURING_3_UFOPEDIA":"It's not an easy task, figuring out how to fit a huge gun onto a flying craft, how to prevent it from being torn off during firing, or damaging the airframe... Just a tiny sample of the troubles we had to overcome. But are we complaining? Of course not! With this technology, we can start fitting Naval Guns to our vessels, and in time develop other, hopefully even more devastating craft weapons.","STR_CRAFT_MISSILES_UFOPEDIA":"We've figured out how to make missiles equipped with advanced guidance systems, which means long range and high accuracy. Once we know how, all it takes is to refit and repair old Stingray missiles, commonly found in junkyards (as missiles are generally considered an obsolete weapon). All very nice, but where are we going to get advanced electronics from, you ask? It's as simple as gutting Slave AI systems. One should be enough for a dozen of missiles. The remaining odds and ends we can procure by disassembling advanced handheld weapons.","STR_SQUIRE_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: sq{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 0.5{NEWLINE}Don't say these boys don't work hard, Cap'n! They're really trying but consider all the time they're being distracted by our crew in common home clothing, and all the research we need to do on them! Yes, I agree they should be punished - do you want squires delivered to your quarters like everyone else? Or will it be hopefully a public punishment...?{NEWLINE}Ugh, but I tell you, these boys can become something more in time, I'm sure of it!","STR_SLAVE_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: S{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 1.5{NEWLINE}Captured enemy males who lack any valuable skills are put to simple menial work at our hideout, which translates into extra 1.5 points of storage space. Not everyone is fit to be a slave; some captives are too headstrong and dangerous to risk it, while also being uninterested in any special accommodations we can realistically provide. Some are simply too weak. Some, like civilians or high government officials, have to be spared this fate on politi... on the moral grounds.","STR_SLAVE_MAID_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: s{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 1.25{NEWLINE}Captured females without any special skills are turned into maids, to keep the base generally tidier and cater to our every whim. Still we don't drive them as hard as male slaves, because they're gals like us, right? Yeah, right.","STR_SLAVE_SKILLED_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: S+{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 4.5{NEWLINE}Enemies with good technical expertise are hard to find. We have to value them highly and treat them better than normal slaves, but even with less work hours, their contribution to a Hideout's economy is a major one - who else would repair all that fancy hi-tech equipment? Especially if the alternative is some quality bath time?","STR_SLAVE_MANAGER_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: ${NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 6{NEWLINE}These slaves are the pride of any hideout, hence we don't spare any expense on their fancy clothing. They can help us greatly with all administrative and logistic work, and, being females, are prettier, uh, I mean, can be trusted to some degree, as long as we can provide them with good accommodations.","STR_SLAVE_BRUTE_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: S@{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 2.25{NEWLINE}Not all slaves are agreeable with our arrangements, but some intimidation and little punishment works wonders in changing that attitude. All the better if this job can be relegated to the slaves themselves. Some of our strong enemies are perfectly fit and quite willing to take the position, once properly encouraged - we only have to keep them from being overzealous.","STR_SLAVE_GLADIATRIX_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: S^{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 3.5{NEWLINE}There is money to be earned from gladiatorial combat, not even mentioning the fun, so these pit-fighters are an important part of our slave enterprise, and the Smugglers deliver fancy gladiatorial gear. Besides, such a fate serves these tenacious harlots just right.","STR_SLAVE_MAGICAL_UFOPEDIA":"Workshop Code: S*{NEWLINE}Work Efficiency: 7{NEWLINE}One of the rarest kind of slaves are enemy mages. They have to be kept under constant surveillance, but can greatly contribute to our economy with some of their powers - when equipped with expensive, prisoner-grade psionic gear we get from the Smugglers. Letting them wear anything else is just too dangerous. And they don't deserve it anyway, considering the pain they were in combat!","STR_YEOMAN_UFOPEDIA":"Work Efficiency: 1.75{NEWLINE}It's time for our boys to grow up and support our rising empire!{NEWLINE}With the help of our Runts, we will school them in the arts of knavery and combat. How do we do it?

Each farm needs tools and animals we need to buy, a loyal Yeoman, his bride and a minimum of 5 Slaves to do the menial work so the former two can stay civilized and focus on intellectual pursuits, management and training. What a big societal advancement! Long live the Queen!","STR_SLAVE_MAID_SUPER_UFOPEDIA":"Work Efficiency: 3.25{NEWLINE}With some magic, we're able to turn our Slave Maids into a powerful and gorgeous workforce, basically tripling their value. We need a Luxury Spa at our Hideout to perform the proper training.","STR_SLAVE_SERVITOR_UFOPEDIA":"Work Efficiency: 100{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Automated drones are more effective than slaves.

They will become a nice addition to our Hideout's shantytown.","STR_SLAVE_ROBOT_UFOPEDIA":"Work Efficiency: 5.5{NEWLINE}This robotic servant might be more temperamental and feisty than a well-trained living slave (maybe because of the bad people who programmed it, which be us), but it works much harder.","STR_LIFTER_UFOPEDIA":"An ubiquitous device, found in ships, housing, transport platforms etc, characterized by a red, green or blue glow. Its magics seem to work by locally altering the force of gravity, aka the same force that makes a vessel with blasted engines crash down to Earth, or a kicked midget crash down the stairs. After some meditations on the nature of these magics, which involved smoking strange stuff while sitting inside an old engine and talking about arcane subjects while wearing next to nothing, we feel we have a much better understanding of the machine-spirits that make them work. Also, a cryptic message for you: 'Don't Stand On Lifters During Takeoff'.","STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA":"The heart of any ship is an anti-matter reactor which uses Hellerium (Isotope 511) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy.  The conversion of matter to energy is an incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of Hellerium can produce a huge amount of power. Now we have a better understanding of how to tweak this power to our needs.","STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA":"This semi-sentient, highly-adaptable 'drone AI' is a crucial component of any vessel, but it is used for great many other tasks too, like managing enviro controls, supervising assembly lines or even commanding automated vehicles. The inner workings of this device are too arcane to fathom, but we have gained enough understanding of it to custom-tailor its input, peripherals and interface to receive desired output.","STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"From the schematics we have procured, we have learned that military-class ships are constructed in a wholly different way, around a hardened plastasteel frame laced with super-conductive wiring for heat dissipation that gives them their toughness, as well as allows them to endure high speeds and accelerations within a planet's atmosphere.{NEWLINE}Tougher ships will have the ARMOR parameter; armor negates an amount of damage equal to its rating after each hit, making small weapons less useful against them.","STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA":"The life support systems of the Stellar Empire rely on custom-tailored microbes that feed directly on electrical energy. They rapidly break down the body refuse of complex organisms and produce nutrients, clean water and breathable air. Here we have pictured a curious practice of dumping dead bodies into the life support tanks to quickly produce large amounts of nutrients, but this particular use seems pointless (besides some terror value) - why waste perfectly fine meat? Anyway, with this knowledge, we have a crucial stepping stone towards enviro-sealed suits and vessels.","STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"This is the Holy Grail of medical technology - a vat where a desired body part, or even a whole new body, can be rapidly grown, healed, or upgraded. Expensive and sought-after, it can provide anything from being simply a convenient medical device to creating virtual demigods. The device we obtained is only a minor version of a true RETEGES Chamber, but is enough to study the underlying tech.","STR_ALIEN_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA":"These strange, alluring wall panels contain strange, crystal circuitry, and cause effects similar to hallucinogenic drugs. We can only describe the effects as magic. Be sure to advise your hands not to look at them for too long. These panels, naturally, are highly valued on the market, but, if we dare, we can also rip out the circuitry to put it in devices of our own making. Not like we have the slightest idea how and if it would work.","STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA":"This fully self-contained unit uses laser cutters, EM devices and other arcane technology to perform sophisticated medical procedures almost as simply as pushing a button. It can however also be used to other ends, such as interrogations or working with organic-like synthetic technology.","STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA":"The purpose of this device is to scan the minuscule structure of materials and replicate it. With one installed in our Lab, we can fool around with it, but the actual expertise needs to be learned from Trader and Academy Engineers. Actual construction of complex equipment requires developing a suitable workshop type, though.","STR_ALIEN_HABITAT_UFOPEDIA":"These pods are used to keep the occupant in suspended animation. They're often outfitted with medical devices as well. This technology is crucial for space travel, as it allows ship crew to sleep for years while aging only days.","STR_SMUGGLED_ELECTRONICS":"Optronics Smuggling","STR_SMUGGLED_ELECTRONICS_UFOPEDIA":"Turns out we uncovered quite a sensation - there appears to be some kind of manufacturing center of Optronics here, on Earth, run by the Technocracy. The Smugglers have some top secret links with this business, which allows them to snatch the Optronics right at the source, at a fraction of the price. What's curious is that the Guild has no direct control over this, they're just a buyer. The merchandise is anyway rumored to be produced in such quantities that most of it is shipped to far-off planets of the Stellar Empire.","STR_INTERSTELLAR_TRAVEL_SUMMARY":"Interstellar Travel","STR_INTERSTELLAR_TRAVEL_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"The Stellar Empire employs so-called 'Warping' to travel between nearby stars in a matter of weeks. Longer distance travel involves deep space oddities, known as 'black holes', hosting 'jump gates'. Only a limited number of vessels are equipped to travel through these, and the closest are on Mars: Transstellar hellerium freighters and Marsec deep space fighters.

But it aren't we who be robbing, how comes? Hitting the robbers we can liberate whatever they have stolen, while saving the local population will earn us popularity points. I feel almost sorry for these bandits. Almost.","STR_ATTACK_BANDIT_RAID_UFOPEDIA":".","STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA":"A few small ships of one or another Faction will fly to-and-fro (normally Runabouts and Cutters), and we can bring them down. Or ignore them.","STR_ALIEN_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA":"Resistance against the activities of most factions is nothing new, and the most direct way of dealing with it is a military action. After a preliminary wave of Escorts, Gunships and Fighters, the dreaded Bombers are sent to impose fear, or, if the need arises, deliver oblivion to their hapless victims. These missions, if successful, will noticeably decrease our notoriety, but it is difficult to stop them - as it means going toe-to-toe with man'o'wars in the air, there are no landings.","STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_UFOPEDIA":"While a general resistance is best dealt with an overwhelming force, sometimes a more surgical approach is needed. Pacification features scouting and fly-bys by Fighters and Escorts, and when the areas of unrest are pinpointed, Gunships, Terror Ships and Envoys deliver elite troops to deal with the offenders on the ground, with extreme prejudice. Success of such missions will decrease our notoriety.","STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_PIR_UFOPEDIA":"A Commercial activity performed throughout the Stellar Empire on alien planets inhabited by pre-spacefaring species. Specimens of local sentient races are ambushed and stunned, to be carried off into space. Usually the utmost care is taken to not overtly damage the prisoner, and escape unseen. Any witnesses are either abducted as well, or destroyed with superior weapons. Abductees are then used either for study, documentation, or direct sale in one of Empire's commercial hubs.","STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA":"Sometimes rich people travel around the planet in luxury yachts. Catching one is like free cash.","STR_MISSION_SWAY_GOVT_UFOPEDIA":"This mission is aimed at attacking our funding base. As you know, the local governments balance between cooperating with the big factions (and by extension, the Star Gods) and respecting the needs of the population and the voice of the Mutant Alliance. Here, a faction aims at coercing (i.e. threatening) one or another local govt into being 'tough on crime' and taking more direct steps against felons like us. Our enemies are the big Factions, and by extension, the Star Gods themselves, so you can bet on the targeted local govt to eventually succumb, sever any ties with us and stop paying us protection money - forever.","STR_ALIEN_BASE_UFOPEDIA":"Sometimes, the factions build secret bases in secluded areas of the planet, where they can perform any activity that's best left unknown to the population at large (and their competition). However, this secluded location gives us an opportunity to strike, loot the place and disappear into the sunset before massive reinforcements can arrive. On the other hand, each Secret Base that exists steadily undermines our position. A Secret Base is bound to be filled with loot, information (which we can use to blackmail people and otherwise increase our global standing), and is a prime place to look for the highest-ranking members of a faction. The final stages of building a base are a special event - they're signified with massed Supply Ship, Frigate and Cruiser activity. The window of opportunity to strike is short, though, no more than a day.","STR_ALIEN_TERROR_UFOPEDIA":"These 'surgical raids' against 'terrorist leaders' are a sad reality of our times. From time to time, a faction sends its death squads to one city or another to, as it turns out from our interrogation, 'cull the mutant numbers a little as they're breeding too fast anyway'. We can thwart such an attempt early, simply by shooting Terror Ships down, but waiting out and making a surprise appearance at the party can potentially garner us more respect (unless we let too many locals die). In some cases, attackers don't use ships and come by land instead. In such events, the Mutant Alliance will dispatch a Hyperwave distress call. Whether we care about the hapless fools who get massacred or not, it's always an opportunity to grab some loot an fame.","STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA":"If we shoot down someone's shippings, they will send their man'o'wars looking for us. Our ships are employing cloaking technology, and the hideouts are - well, hidden, but with enough luck and effort they can still be discovered, especially those which are used to launch interceptions. Our enemies are likely to fail and make idiots of themselves anyway, but if they don't, expect them to arrive numerous and armed to the teeth. On the bright side, if we kick their asses, their policy is to cover the failure up and they won't return anytime soon. A Crackdown is performed by ships like Sentries, Fighters, Gunships and Cruisers. If any of them manages to get within about 100 miles from our hideout, expect a landing ship coming fast at it very soon. There are 5 variants of these ships, and some will break easily through any feasible AA defenses, but once the enemy gets boots on the ground, the advantage is ours. The enemy will only be able to deploy in Hangars and the Access Lift.","STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA":"Wherever a Secret Base exists, it needs to be constantly supplied. Tracking a supply run to its landing zone is a sure-fire way to find a Secret Base.","STR_MISSION_FREIGHT_UFOPEDIA":"The Traders' Guild is the biggest cargo transporting company by far, constantly moving stuff around the planet. They not only maintain their own supply chain, but also take a lot of government contracts for moving least-to-moderately important stuff. So many Freighters are operating at once that the Guild cannot protect them all, and they're not very well armed themselves, so consider them fair game! Just think about all the expensive stuff inside, waiting for us. Freighters have moderately big crews, but they're mostly weak and cowardly, so we should just capture and sell them. However, Freighters rarely land in the wilderness, so we need to shoot them down else they'll land in cities, out of our reach.","STR_MISSION_HEAVY_FREIGHT_UFOPEDIA":"In response to increasing danger to their trade routes (in no small part due to us), the Guild decided to step up their defensive measures. From now on, we can expect the amount of normal traffic to decrease, in favour of Heavy Freighter flights. The presence of such imposing vessels is sure to increase the perception of the Guild's power, thus each successful mission of this type will cost us 500 points of Notoriety.","STR_MISSION_MINING_UFOPEDIA":"Mining ships make easy, if not too valuable targets. They survey an area then proceed to extract valuable minerals, which takes a few days. These missions are flown by various factions, mostly Traders but also the Academy and local govts - so be sure whom you're killing while on the ground. Mining ships always perform prolonged landings in the wild, that's where they're easy to attack.","STR_MISSION_GOLD_TRANSPORT_UFOPEDIA":"Both the Govts and Traders conduct these highly interesting missions. After a few fly-bys of Gunboats, an armored Freighter will appear, filled with very valuable cargo. It won't land in any accessible location, so our only chance to get the loot is to shoot it down.","STR_MISSION_MILITARY_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA":"These missions are flown by Spartans, Raiders, Govt. After watching several Light Gunboats circling around, watch out for the main dish - a Military Transport, laden with low-tech but plentiful military gear. It can be blown out of the sky, but definitely has to eventually stop somewhere, and for a fair duration.","STR_MISSION_COURIER_UFOPEDIA":"Both the Academy and the Traders need to transport important people and parcels quickly. Such courier missions are usually performed using small, fast ships, which have little in the way of defense but are so fast that catching up with them could be a problem. Still, if we do manage to do so, they are pretty much defenseless, both in the air and on the ground. Such ships are good opportunities to find rare goods and valuable prisoners.","STR_MISSION_CONVERSION_UFOPEDIA":"The so-called Conversion Missions are one of the staple operations of the Church. Once they hear a rumour of a community whose level of faith is unsatisfactory, they get to work. First, they send out Gunships to pinpoint the offenders and subdue any resistance. Once this phase is completed, Shrine Ships appear to perform the usual shock and awe faith-strengthening procedure. In this latter phase, the Church is more vulnerable to our attacks. On the other hand, successful Conversions inflict some damage to our image.","STR_MISSION_SUPERVISION_UFOPEDIA":"From time to time, the Star Gods show up on Earth to keep the tabs on current going-ons and ensure no-one is breaking their rules. Their ways are always mysterious, as their vessels do not make landings during this mission; either they have means of supervising without direct contact (after all, they have many spies), or they're simply not that much interested in this backwater planet. The Supervisions are flown by Messengers, Envoys and Cruisers.","STR_MISSION_PASSENGER_UFOPEDIA":"Passenger flights are mainly operated by the Traders Guild, but Academicians also maintain their own, smaller network. Most ordinary purebloods that need to travel buy tickets from them. Such flights are performed by cheap, insignificant ships that pose little danger to us. If we shoot down one such vessel, we can expect to fight many people, but most of them aren't much of a threat. However there is one fine point: do not expect such an attack to be particularly popular if you slaughter and capture civilians (Trader personnel is free game). Passenger ships land mostly in cities, so it's often required to shoot them down to get them.","STR_MISSION_SURVEY_UFOPEDIA":"Survey missions are conducted by The Academy to monitor all sorts of activities on Earth, ranging from vegetation to human activity. During these missions they gather samples of plants, animals and people to conduct experiments on them. They also abduct any local mages they can find. We can ignore these missions, as they don't hurt us at all, but on the other hand we can take these ships down and take them apart, so why not do so?","STR_MISSION_DIPLOMACY_UFOPEDIA":"Both The Academy and The Guild need to maintain close ties to the government. Diplomatic missions are crucial to this, and they are conducted periodically by both sides. They represent little threat to us, but they are an opportunity to capture someone important.","STR_MISSION_MERCENARY_ASSIGNMENT_UFOPEDIA":"The Mercenaries conduct their dirty business all year long. Generally they're of little threat to us... unless we cross them. They fly deadly vessels like Heavy Gunships or Frigates and are armed to the teeth. Shooting down any of these ships, even if successful, is assured to have repercussions.","STR_MISSION_RAID_UFOPEDIA":"Raids are usually organized by Raiders, sometimes by Spartans. They normally choose targets that are away from any settlements, preferably defenseless peasants. Raid parties rarely have good weapons, but they make up for this with numbers and tenacity. Killing raiders isn't enormously profitable, but everybody has to start somewhere, right? At least the chance of Raiders mounting a Crackdown mission in response are very low.","STR_MISSION_GOVT_PATROL_UFOPEDIA":"The truth is, Govt ships can be recognized simply by red-and-blue lights they bear (normally Fighters and Ordinators). The provincial govts mind their business, and they pay us our racket money, so it's kinda faux pas to attack them, but their bigger craft carry valuable booty, so it's your choice, Cap'n!","STR_MISSION_SMUGGLING_UFOPEDIA":"There are a lot of goods which are strictly regulated, or only available for the outrageous Trader's Guild's prices. Smuggling is the answer. Smuggling ships carry a lot of valuable (and sometimes unique) merchandise, but they're seriously souped-up to avoid interception - by the officials, or just simple folks who want to get rid of the middleman. Er, that be us, Cap'n.","STR_ACTIVITIES_MILITARY_UFOPEDIA":"You have learned all there is to know about Military missions. Your tactical genius is unmatched.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)","STR_ACTIVITIES_ENTERPRISE_UFOPEDIA":"You have learned just about everything about modern Enterprising. Now you'll be always one step ahead of the competition.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)","STR_ACTIVITIES_COMMERCIAL_UFOPEDIA":"You have learned the inside outs of all Commercial activities. You have become a street legend.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)","STR_ACTIVITIES_POLITICAL_UFOPEDIA":"You have gained the full understanding of Political activities. Your spies are everywhere.{NEWLINE}(Increased influence - 1000 points awarded)","STR_MISSION_REBEL_TRADING_UFOPEDIA":"Through sharing our manufacturing methods with the low classes of the world, we have managed to undermine the economical standing of Star Gods' servants. Rebel Freighters, run either by the Mutant Alliance or Provincial Govt, are starting to create an independent trade. This mission will run every month, replacing some Faction activities, and generating up to 1000 points towards our Infamy.","STR_BLACKMARCH_UFOPEDIA":"The inhabitants of this country are known for their combat mettle and fierce pride. They prefer rural life, as large cities tend to draw heavy artillery fire. Same goes for organized infrastructure - forest pathways and animal transport makes poor targets for bombing. Many have taken the locals for unwashed and uneducated primitives, which appears only to be partly true, as the country has not only held off several invasions through their combination of guerrilla warfare and expert military training, but was even able to expand its territories, and it could perhaps become a major power if not for the locals' very vocal distrust in any form of peacetime government or their inability to conform to any non-military rules or regulations. Only two cities can be found in this land - sprawling Free City where the locals convene to form their Parliament, and an imposing fortress, The Bastion, serving as a bulwark against Bad Things that dwell in the south.","STR_CALIFORNIA_REPUBLIC_UFOPEDIA":"Known for its peculiar political system, called 'democracy', as well as for being the world's leading power in movie production. Their ruler, called a 'President', is always chosen by the general vote (voting is easy, as all TV sets have touchscreens) from the most popular movie stars in a monthly poll; the poll also decides what to do with the former president, a popular choice being 'death on the stage' (the local movie industry prides itself that no effects are faked). In this land of the free, there is no police and little government, so the order is enforced by highly fanatical death-squads of a fully hermetic (through the feat of inbreeding) Hubbologist Order. It is only natural that the leaders of this organization, engaged in such ungrateful and hard work take two-thirds of everyone else's earnings. After all, they don't revere Dollar the Allmighty for nothing.","STR_CENTRAL_PROVINCE_UFOPEDIA":"With almost a 100 million citizens, the Central Province is the most populous country on the planet. Its rulers boast about their unshakeable loyalty to the Empire. Their belief is that rule of the superiors over inferiors is the divine order of things, and when the Star Gods arrived, it was only natural to pledge allegiance. They also claim that their land is the most beloved by the Star Gods. The question if the Star Gods can feel any love remains open, but there's no doubt the Central Province has been loved quite roughly and thoroughly; most of it is a cratered death zone, rendered uninhabitable by chemical, biological and nuclear contamination, not even mentioning strange monsters and other, bizarre and unexplained phenomena. Less influenced areas (which doesn't mean safe) are inhabited by dirt-poor peasants, struggling to harvest enough rice to feed relatively more fortunate inhabitants of underground cities. Strangely, the locals do not complain too much, maybe because complaining can make you an organ donor.","STR_CONFEDERATION_UFOPEDIA":"The Confederation is the bread basket of the world, their humongous agriculture powered by equally humongous numbers of slaves (their main import and close to 80% of the population). No effort was spared (including unsurprisingly many, many slaves' lives) to learn how to domesticate (and turn profit on) vicious forms of fauna and flora like Cowyotes, Tentacle Vines or Carnocorn. With the passage of centuries, the success, as the plantation owners agree over a glass of the finest moonshine, has been spectacular. The Confederation has no real central government other than a loose board of wealthiest grandees, but they're rich enough to buy the best guns and mercenaries, and the free people, for the lack of daily burdens, are all well trained in combat. And perhaps most importantly, each of the Confederation's neighbors currently has too much on their own plate to think about invading, with the possible exception of the Latin Empire.","STR_DARK_DOMINION_UFOPEDIA":"This country is ruled by a shadowy council of eight Masked Mages. The population, numbering over 70 million, is considerably well off, living mostly in small towns and agricultural communities. The wealth of the country, both in tech and money is pretty considerable. So why such an ominous name, a child would ask? The Mages, backed by a huge, fanatical cult, openly worship what they call the 'Dark Gods'. And the ways of worship are many - starting with a huge number of taboos (like the ban on motorized vehicles), naturally punished by a painful death, ending with, what else, mass human sacrifices. Strangely enough, this system seems to be working, as the Deep Ones do not bother locals too much, and even the Church of Sirius usually avoids these parts of the planet. Aside from their strange religion and dark magics, the Dominion is known for its mastery in production of various mind-altering drugs, both widely used by the locals and exported abroad (if the Mages allow).","STR_DEATH_REALMS_UFOPEDIA":"Names are often misleading. But not in this case. The whole country is a blasted wasteland that's out to kill you. The wildlife consists of giant, poisonous scorpions, giant, poisonous spiders, giant, poisonous plants... you're probably starting to see the pattern. And if you avoid those, there is always plentiful and deadly UV radiation. There are four heavily fortified cities that host close to 20 million population. Not to be outdone by the local nature, the rulers devised an ingenious way to simultaneously deal with overcrowding, low morale, poverty and scarcity of food supplies: televised death games, played either in death arenas, death mazes, death pits or plainly on city streets. The participants are chosen at random. There is big money to be won (and being rich means food and clean air), but most of the contestants end up murdered (extra points are rewarded for creative kills) and thrown into nutrient-recycling vats. Somehow, few outsiders show any interest in this merry land.","STR_EURASIAN_AUTONOMY_UFOPEDIA":"Since this area of the world stood the most defiant against the Star Gods invasion, it has been thoroughly brutalized by both the Gods and their human proxies. After a hundred years or so of not-entirely-successful operation, the Star Gods finally called quits and left the few remaining local survivors to their own devices. The modern day EA is a part of the Star Gods province system, but, while basically a non-actor on the international scene, with the leadership corrupted by one or another foreign power, it has a reputation of a 'land where nothing can be done' - doing business there is subjecting yourself to endless delays, incompetence, robbery, shoddy workmanship, unforeseen difficulties and so on... Strangely, all the attempts of civilizing this seemingly weak country ended in tears, up to and including mysterious explosions of atomic bombs, which, supposedly, were all long since scrapped by the Star Gods.","STR_EUROSYNDICATE_UFOPEDIA":"An industrial and technological powerhouse with over 80 million citizens, this corporate state is the wealthiest on the planet, hampered as it might be by infighting and the universal ban on global travel all local govts have to adhere to. While Europe bore the brunt of a nuclear war fought in the early days of Star Gods occupation, the Eurosyndicate rose from the ashes, building enclosed cities with intricate filtration systems and virtual reality networks. Food is grown in great underground caverns and is reportedly quite edible. That's all perhaps enough to sweeten universal debt-slavery and incessant shootouts between police, corporate forces and criminals (in varied configurations), none of whom care too much about collateral damage. The elites live in luxury, surrounded by their famous gen-engineered servants and infamous cybernetic hitmen, and quietly dream about dominating the globe.","STR_FUSO_UFOPEDIA":"Whatever international standing Fuso has comes only from its rich and sprawling capitol of Sunrise, where most of its technology and wealth is concentrated under the watchful eye of the Emperor and a host of industrial cartels. But their power ends about a dozen paces off the city limits, and the rest of this scarcely populated land is torn by incessant warfare between local warlords, over the years relying more and more on medieval weapons because ammo costs money. Average locals haven't even heard of electricity. Unsurprisingly, the country is mostly known for its swords, martial arts and ars moriendi.","STR_GHOSTGATES_UFOPEDIA":"Rumours say the country is haunted, and if you take a wrong turn, you could find a vampire or worse. Legend has it, just after conquering the Earth, the Star Gods had to curb excess population levels of that time, so they resettled billions of people from the whole Euroasia onto the isolated subcontinent, only to destroy them with a host of nasty plagues, some killing outright, some causing slow agony, some putting people in a death-like state or doing even more bizarre things. While the notion that there could ever be a billion people living on the planet (let alone multiple billions) seems a bit of a stretch, Ghostgates is definitely spooky, with its endless old boneyards and ruins, scattered throughout lush jungles , and its silent, big-eyed inhabitants, living in dozens of disparate counties and towns. Not to mention that the five aristocratic families of old, who have the right to elect the local Patriarch, could well be the vampires of legend judging by their looks and decadence.","STR_HIDDEN_EXPANSE_UFOPEDIA":"The African continent was very rich and populous in the ages of yore, but all that ended with the Deep Ones invasion. The chaos they brought emboldened the local wild Sectoid tribes and attracted all kinds of freaks of nature, insane enough to worship the Deep Ones' gods (which might be less dangerous than the Star Gods, probably, but are certainly much crazier). The 15 or so million people who still hold on to this rump of a state are well-fortified, determined and never far from their flamethrowers and artillery pieces. Those who can afford it, generally flee, usually to find disenchantment abroad - despite all the danger, it is said that the Knight-Generals who rule the Hidden Expanse keep reasonable order, with the execution rate almost on par with the homicide rate, which is a feat by itself.","STR_INDONESIA_UFOPEDIA":"A teeming country ruled by a dynamic (read: much bloodshed) trust of the most powerful criminal organizations. Exports: pleasure in every form. Imports: military hardware.","STR_IRON_TRIBE_UFOPEDIA":"While this important, if largely depopulated country can hardly be called a tribe nowadays, the origin of the name can be traced several centuries back, when the isles housed nothing but stone-age tribes. The Iron Tribe had some pre-invasion tech, great ambitions and unmatched tenacity, and, because of that, there eventually were no other tribes anymore. The nation grew rich enough to restore some electrical grid and steam train service - low tech but none the less amazing feats. Most of the population is dispersed throughout fortified villages, separated by large swathes of foreboding wilderness, but for their capitol, the Iron Tribe reclaimed the ancient city of Spectral... which was quite a bold move, as the haunted ruins host a huge, mysterious and seemingly indestructible (not for the lack of tries) transdimensional gate. Regularly there is something unspeakable coming out of it and doing unspeakable things. The well-organized (if lacking heavy equipment) military is usually able to eventually repel such guests, but none of many expeditions sent through the gate ever returned.","STR_KINGDOM_OF_CANADA_UFOPEDIA":"A very full of itself monarchy, currently ruled by Her Majesty, Queen Aurora the 2nd. Quite nice people, actually, until they stone you to death for smoking tobacco or exposing your thighs in public. The red-uniformed RCF (Royal Canadian Forces) are constantly on alert against Things From The North, Things From The Sea, Generally Indecent People and occasional Technocracy robotic spies. Other than that, a boring place.","STR_LATIN_EMPIRE_UFOPEDIA":"An old, but recently growing power built on conquest, education, artistic flair and social inequality. After subjugating the surrounding areas and repelling Deep Ones, its eyes more and more often look to the north; the Confederation might not be able to stand up to the might of Imperial Legions, and they have so many slaves that could be used much more efficiently...","STR_NORTHERN_FEDERATION_UFOPEDIA":"A bleak place that's relatively well off, which isn't that hard considering the state of neighboring lands. The government tries to manage with what limited resources they have, thus they're enforcing strict population limits. The locals are not really supposed to complain, else they might well be expelled from this heavily-policed paradise on earth and might find themselves on the other side of the border. Multiple layers of barbed wire, interlocking minefields and automated machinegun emplacements, set to shoot anything that moves, make sure that said border is somewhat harder to traverse in the opposite direction.","STR_RED_REVOLUTION_UFOPEDIA":"Yet another country run by religious whackos, this time having nothing to do with the Star Gods cult, though. The Church of the Red Revolution reveres a prophetic-like figure, Marx Guevara, who is said to have been martyred in between two hundred - two hundred thousand years ago (depending on scripture) and is supposed to come back to deliver all the Revolutionists from evil, and send all the other people to an eternity of creative torment. This joyous event is supposed to happen any day now. Meanwhile the Revolutionists are busy implementing the tenets of their religion (abolition of private property, simple living, helping each other and unquestioningly following orders of the priesthood), chasing sinners (who are then, naturally, subjected to creative cruelty) and frantically arming themselves - not long ago this land was contested between the Latin Empire and the Confederation.","STR_ROGUE_FIELDS_UFOPEDIA":"This deserted country is divided between a dozen rich, powerful and bombastic warlords, each keeping his own army. While the clashes between those 'Lords of War' as they call themselves, are pretty commonplace, they are united by a common interest: piracy. Large fleets of flying and seaborne ships are ready to strike any country which lowers its guard and run away, cargo bays filled with loot and slaves, before the smoke begins to clear - only to later trade the spoils on the global market, not infrequently to the former owners. The wealth of gold, tech and weapons thus gathered over centuries, along with the geography, protects the Lords from any meaningful retribution, not even mentioning mundane threats like the Deep Ones. The Lords are, naturally, tyrannical, but the locals follow the 'live fast, die young' motto, and when there is no war, ride in the great death-races that are the biggest sports events on the planet. There is no shortage of motorized vehicles either, as the Rogue Fields is the world's top producer of oil-burning machinery, riding, sailing or flying.","STR_ROMANICA_UFOPEDIA":"The most iconic features of the landscape are numerous stone castles, from small keeps to sprawling fortresses, fortified with every known weapon, up to intercontinental missiles. These castles are ancestral homes to numerous aristocratic families, jointly ruling the land, often clashing, sometimes even warring with each other. The country is mostly deforested and dusty, but still contains huge swathes of agriculture, farmed by local peasants who are often reasonably well off (that is, until some clashing faction sets their houses on fire), but are forbidden to possess any advanced technology. The capital, Ground Zero is mostly neutral zone where the landlords meet to discuss general politics; the families might often hate each other, but they hate the neighboring countries even more. The capital's name comes from the old tale, that during the nuclear war, an ancient city that stood there was hit by the first and biggest warhead of mass destruction. Hardly any ruins remain, and today's city is a place of numerous luxury entertainment establishments.","STR_STEEL_PACT_UFOPEDIA":"For centuries, the western coastline of South America was home to half-a-dozen piss-poor tiny states, clinging to what little they could harvest from the sea and protected from the Amazonian Deep Ones by the mountains. Those mountains couldn't protect them from the tsunami waves that utterly devastated the tiny states, or from the Dark Dominion which quickly capitalized on neighbor's bad luck by invading them. However, one Commandante Bolivar rose as head of the resistance, and then as head of the alliance, when the occupiers were thrown out. A master of propaganda, he managed to turn this backwater into a land of belching low-tech factories and united nationalistic fervour. It is obvious that the godless Dark Dominion is responsible for all the bad things that happened. Huge contingents of steel tanks and men in black uniforms stand ready to confront the Dominion's superior technology with superior numbers, dedication and tactics. The war can break out at any moment now, especially after everyone suspected of jeopardizing the country's effort, their families and their dogs are exterminated.","STR_TECHNOCRACY_UFOPEDIA":"Little is known of the inner workings of the Technocracy, as almost no one leaves the country - and those who do, are as clueless as outsiders, speaking of a life in sprawling industrial cities, amongst masses of zombie-like compatriots. There is no question though that the Technocracy is big on all things cybernetic, from surveillance systems to outright robots and cyborgs. As the rulers of the country seem to be completely silent to the outside world, the vision of endless armies of automata setting out some day to conquer the planet is a popular scare in the neighboring lands. However, such an event has yet to happen, and the general consensus is that the Technocracy is ears-deep in internal trouble, caused by social unrest, the heavy tithes the Star Gods demand, and, if you're willing to listen to wilder rumors, by rogue machines.","STR_THEBAN_TYRANNY_UFOPEDIA":"Not much was happening in this desert country, inhabited by what remained of local Arabic peoples (estimated 95% extinction) until a ruler rose virtually out of nothing about two centuries ago. Styling herself as 'Cleopatra', she imposed her rule with the help of an extremely powerful battlemage (both of them are said to surpass even the Star Gods in sorcery), and kept herself and her most valuable servants alive and youthful through the means of arcane biotechnology. Said biotechnology was also used to breed whole armies of supersoldiers and workers (this not-to-keen-on-thinking crowd now constitutes most of the population) to subjugate surrounding areas. A sole, huge city of Thebes was built in the Nile Valley, and its absolute mistress, sitting on the top of the Silver Pyramid, has her eyes on new conquests... An eventual clash with the currently leading local power, the Eurosyndicate, seems inevitable, meanwhile the rulers of Romanica frantically arm themselves and prepare for the worst.","STR_TURAN_UFOPEDIA":"The endless, scarcely populated expanses of Central Asia turned out to be cost prohibitive for even the Star Gods to control.  Consequently, the areas stayed mostly untouched by the globe-wide devastation. About three centuries ago a coherent power coalesced out of local nomadic peoples: Turan. Keeping to themselves (both figuratively and literally, as they expertly scavenge whatever technology and servants they can) in this chaotic world, they built a society based on simple, harsh yet relatively just laws, ruled by the strongest warlord from the fortress-city of Karakorum. Most of the population still keeps to their nomadic ways of life, often wandering past Crossroads as far as Romanica to feed their herds and trade. Reputed as fierce warriors, they really don't appreciate strangers meddling in their affairs. Like, head-on-a-pike not appreciate. If you don't offend them, though, they're quite hospitable, they'll feed you and tend to your injuries, just don't be surprised to find yourself relieved of all possessions.","STR_AREAS_AMERICA":"World Lore: America","STR_AREAS_EUROPE":"World Lore: Europe ","STR_AREAS_ASIA":"World Lore: Asia ","STR_AREAS_SOUTH":"World Lore: Southern Enclaves","STR_AREAS_AMERICA_UFOPEDIA":"(1000 pts awarded)","STR_AREAS_EUROPE_UFOPEDIA":"(1000 pts awarded)","STR_AREAS_ASIA_UFOPEDIA":"(1000 pts awarded)","STR_AREAS_SOUTH_UFOPEDIA":"(1000 pts awarded)","STR_GUILD_ALARMED":"The Guild is alarmed","STR_GUILD_ANGRY":"The Guild is angry","STR_REPORT_001":"Stellar Empire Report 001","STR_REPORT_002":"Stellar Empire Report 002","STR_REPORT_003":"Stellar Empire Report 003","STR_REPORT_001_UFOPEDIA":"+++Blessed are works of The Masters + Eternal is their rule+++{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}PLANET KHEMI POPULATION BREAKDOWN{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Numbers in millions, approx.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}OLD-TYPE BASELINES......27{NEWLINE}SANCTIONED STRAINS.....373{NEWLINE}WILD STRAINS...................223{NEWLINE}DEEP DWELLERS............13570","STR_REPORT_002_UFOPEDIA":"+++Blessed are works of The Masters + Eternal is their rule+++{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}CAUTION{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Exercise restraint when linking telepathically with the members of local population, especially outside of the ruling class, since their neural pathways are cluttered with strong engrams of empathy, sexual reproduction and mammalian physiological features.

However, attacks with airbreather fighters yielded few successes.","STR_HISTORY_002_UFOPEDIA":"Eventually, more than a half of human leaders submitted to Star Gods rule. The others remained defiant. This situation lasted for more than a decade, tensions rising, finally culminating with a global nuclear war. The Star Gods stepped in to stop the hostilities, but millions had perished. As the nuclear winter descended, most of the military opposition to the invaders either yielded or was unable to continue organised resistance.","STR_HISTORY_003_UFOPEDIA":"The Star Gods allowed most loyal human leaders to stay in power, but as decades progressed, little in the way of the wonders they'd promised for the planet had materialized, while Earth was ravaged by waves of strange diseases. Social unrest and rebellion were widespread, only to be brutally put down every time they erupted.","STR_HISTORY_004_UFOPEDIA":"{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Even as Earth's population was dwindling to an eventual couple hundred of million, and the planet was ravaged by hunger, disease and poverty, the human elites weren't unhappy.

In rare cases when they were ambushed on the ground or at low altitude, the Govts' forces always prevailed. It was therefore theorized that the planet's forces could fight and defeat the Stellar Empire's ground invasion. However, that kind of invasion never happened.","STR_HISTORY_007_UFOPEDIA":"There were no major ground battles during the invasion, and skirmishes mostly happened when the Star Gods committed terrorist attacks against civilian population. Humans were usually able to fend off such attacks at a high cost of life, but apart from some bits and pieces of alien tech, such victories were irrelevant on the strategical level.","STR_HISTORY_008_UFOPEDIA":"The most stalwart of all the warriors of the Old Earth were the Knights of Cydonia. The legend has it that when the Earth was already lost to the Stellar Empire, they made an impossible voyage to Mars in a last ditch, desperate attempt to snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat. It is unknown what has become of them.","STR_HISTORY_009_UFOPEDIA":"The Traders' Guild was at first named Marsec: an organization created to supervise colonies on Mars. After most governments on Earth signed treaties with the Star Gods, they were rewarded with stellar technology, which was used to greatly accelerate aerospace engineering and create a permanent human settlement on Mars. However, since the Red Planet already belonged to the Star Gods in all but name, the Star Gods made a condition that no national outposts could be built on Mars, only Marsec would have that right as a global organization. The governments on Earth reluctantly agreed to the deal and so Marsec became the single most influential human agency. A long time later, after the governments collapsed or became isolated, Marsec became just a part of the Guild, as their influence was expanding both inwards (to Earth) and outwards (with new colonies established).","STR_HISTORY_010_UFOPEDIA":"After Earth was flooded with alien artifacts, given to governments by the Star Gods or left after the Majestic 12 were dissolved, a vibrant black market for these goods soon emerged. A vast, global network of ruthless individuals who knew where to get the alien stuff and how to sell it well. This network was an arena of struggle between several criminal cartels, and the last one standing was known as Osiron. With this, Osiron became the biggest player on the alien artifact market, both clandestine and legitimate. Then at some point they were approached by the Star Gods themselves, who offered them a deal: Osiron will stop trading psi tech, and the Star Gods will express gratitude with a steady supply of their devices. Moreover, Osiron would hold the exclusive right to develop psionic abilities, as well as manage wild psions by training or eliminating them. Osiron agreed and the Psi Academy was opened.{NEWLINE}Eventually, Osiron was investing more and more in the Psi Academy, which in turn gained so much power that it gradually overgrew Osiron. The Academy by this point was ruled by an order of female Espers who spoke for themselves, and for Osiron too, who survived as their subordinate order.","STR_HISTORY_011_UFOPEDIA":"United Aerospace Corporation was the sole competition to the earliest form of the Guild in the space race of the XXIst century. While the Guild was formed under the auspices of the Star Gods, the UAC was mostly local Earth initiative, an alliance of private and national corporations. Unlike the Guild, who were interested mostly in prospective Hellerium mining and were happy to use the Stellar Empire's solutions, the UAC was actively developing new technologies. It was finally disgraced and closed down in the early 2090s after a long decline and a series of incidents involving inter-dimensional travel, the most known one in the Iron Tribe area. The UAC was the swan song of the Old Earth civilization, and only after its fall the current sad state of affairs began in the earnest.","STR_GNOME_TOME_3":"Gnome Tome #3","STR_GNOME_TOME_3_UFOPEDIA":"This thick tome tells about a type of gnome, who is living alone in a garden, tending to the plants. She learned how to talk to the flowers, and from them, she heard a lot of naughty stories from around the world. She shares these stories with the reader, always featuring herself as a recurring character. Passed along are her own, not very profound, meditations about the meaning of these stories. We also learn how she likes watching clouds, laying on fresh grass and bathing in ponds, and how a thunderstorm gives her chills.","STR_GNOME_TOME_5":"Gnome Tome #5","STR_GNOME_TOME_5_UFOPEDIA":"This work of fiction tells about a type of gnome, who travels around the world, looking for some very rare book. She's a complete bookworm: you can talk her into practically anything if any books are involved. Because of that, she naturally gets 'somehow' laid a lot with bookish-type men, especially those who can also sport handsome faces and fabulous muscles. The gnome scholar is tireless in her chase for this legendary book, though, and never stays long in one place. She doesn't find it before the story ends.","STR_GNOME_TOME_6":"Gnome Tome #6","STR_GNOME_TOME_6_UFOPEDIA":"This raunchy book describes a type of gnome, who is deeply in love. The object of her adoration however remains mostly indifferent, mainly due to her total lack of social skills (she's otherwise highly intelligent). Frustrated by this, she walks around gloomily, hurting people surrounding her and the man she choose, while getting tormented by her own secret sadistic tendencies. In the end, everyone except herself finds a partner and gets married (very raunchy details on wedding nights). Despite being well-off, she doesn't get laid at all, except with her slaves.","STR_GNOME_TOME_13":"Gnome Tome #13","STR_GNOME_TOME_13_UFOPEDIA":"This gnome considers herself to be an adept of occult arts. This mostly consists of herself wandering around the outskirts of her farm, shooing away crows, getting bitten by mosquitoes and having random encounters with other young villagers.{NEWLINE}She is quite beautiful, and actually gets laid a lot, but she never seems able to maintain the mood.","STR_NEWSPAPER_001":"Giftmasters: A Brand New Menace?","STR_NEWSPAPER_001_UFOPEDIA":"There is an ancient saying: beware the Greeks when they're bearing gifts. No Greeks have been observed, but, in fact, there's a strange new cult on the planet, ones that are called 'Giftmasters'. They are extremely secretive, and they randomly present citizens with gifts of very high technology, never to be seen again. These 'Giftmasters' are considered highly dangerous and are being pursued by elite detectives of the Guild, as well as the Church of Sirius, but will they be able to answer the most nagging questions - who are these 'masters' and of what? And are their gifts really gifts or something else, much more ominous? The world has to know. For now, all citizens are to refuse any technologically advanced gift from a stranger and must immediately report such incidents to the authorities.","STR_NEWSPAPER_002":"Explosions Rock Downtown!","STR_NEWSPAPER_002_UFOPEDIA":"Today at 02:00 AM, the city of Terminus was shaken by a violent explosion which created a 25 m wide crater and destroyed windows in a radius of almost 1 km. This is how the city celebrated the final day of this year's Death Race, the most popular sport in Death Realms! Thousands of people danced in the streets among the charred wrecks of most of these year's participants, many of them from abroad, who wanted to make their dream of just being here, now, to come true. Guild's Passenger Lines flights from Doom Harbor to Terminus are comfy, affordable, and will get you there on time. Never again wish you were somewhere else, just get your ticket now! (All travel requirements apply. Remember to check with your local Guildpost to get your travel permit.)","STR_NEWSPAPER_003":"Weird Goat Worshipped By Heretics","STR_NEWSPAPER_003_UFOPEDIA":"The Academy reports of a strange finding in the region of Dallas, D.C.: a goat with three pairs of horns. This otherwise unremarkable, black animal has already gained a considerable local fame under the name of 'Baddie'. However, although the town's general store noticed a sharp increase in tourism income, the community might be looking at some serious trouble: several bands of Dark Ones were reported near the area. As we were told by our expert Inquisitor Kashub from the Church, these maniacal heretics are most likely converging on the goat in some twisted parody of a religious pilgrimage or coronation. The locals are advised not to leave their homes for the time being, and immediately report any unexplainable observations to the special Academy hotline: 111-GOD.","STR_NEWSPAPER_004":"Concerns About Chryssalid Gas","STR_NEWSPAPER_004_UFOPEDIA":"The latest Chryssalid infestation in the Southern Alpines is mostly gone after two weeks of bombardment by Blackmarch's zeppelins and artillery. Thousands of tons of Chryssalid Gas were used; this horrible weapon works by quickening the already overcharged metabolism of these creatures, making them to literally go up in flames or even explode. Officially, the gas is of little danger to normal life, but the Academy disagrees, saying that overdosage can cause mass extinctions of small creatures, thus imbalancing the biosphere, and even, rarely, ignite poorly-shielded Hellerium equipment. Provost Zakharina herself appealed to the international community to condemn Blackmarch military for their overtly brutal actions.","STR_NEWSPAPER_005":"Rat People - Are They Real?","STR_NEWSPAPER_005_UFOPEDIA":"Rumors of spotting the legendary Rat People surfaced once again, this time in Central Province. Not to be confused with Ratmen, the Rat People are supposed to be actual Beastmen, but as of yet, no conclusive proof of their existence has been found; Explorers who travelled through old caves supposedly housing these strange creatures either returned with nothing, or were later found as melted remains. However, these deaths are hardly a proof of the existence of Rat People - how would such savage and uncivilized Beastmen have an access to high-energy weaponry, or the mental capacity to use it?","STR_NEWSPAPER_006":"Reapers Attack Again","STR_NEWSPAPER_006_UFOPEDIA":"Last week, thousands of mutants from Blackmarch, Romanica and the Eurasian Autonomy travelled to the hamlet of Minsk to observe the annual celebrations of their Festival of the Wagon Tongue. Indeed, many wagons do travel there, filled with mutant troublemakers, fortune-tellers and assorted thieves and brutes. The Academy again suggests a ban on Reaper Chariots in particular, as they're inherently unsafe to both riders and bystanders. The number of victims of this year's celebrations is yet unknown, but likely to reach over a dozen.","STR_NEWSPAPER_007":"Canadian Royal Family Decimated!","STR_NEWSPAPER_007_UFOPEDIA":"Last evening, a thunderous explosion tore through the Canadian Royal Palace, just as the whole royal family was celebrating the 96th birthday of the retired King, Vaclav the Foreigner. The whole Western wing of the palace was levelled, killing many serfs and nobles alike, amongst them almost the whole royal family, including the old King. Queen Aurora the 2nd, who miraculously survived only with minor injuries, immediately ordered martial law, and our sources say that Canadian military forces are preparing to close the southern border. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police disclosed that the likely cause of the explosion was a plasma bomb, but flatly refused the Traders Guild's generous offer of assistance in catching the yet-unknown perpetrators.","STR_NEWSPAPER_008":"Cloaking Devices Do Not Exist","STR_NEWSPAPER_008_UFOPEDIA":"Yesterday's hearing before the Council of Earth concluded the three-year long investigation into the rumored existence of the so-called Cloaking Devices, supposedly able to make ships vanish into thin air. The results, presented by the lead investigator, Colonel Clemborg, are conclusive. No such device, or any solid proof of their existence, has been found. Moreover, their supposed workings are scientifically impossible, which was confirmed by three independent teams of researchers. Even Star God magic is only known to conceal individuals, not whole ships. Naturally, some questions still remain. How did such superstition gain so much traction amongst the population? Was it a conspiracy theory? Or just a conspiracy, aimed at causing unrest and doubt? The Council concluded that people who spread such destructive rumors should be arrested. It's time to put this strange superstition to rest. No invisible predators, inter-dimensional beings or super-pirates lurk in the sky, ready to strike unwary victims.","STR_NEWSPAPER_009":"The Forest of Steel Marches On","STR_NEWSPAPER_009_UFOPEDIA":"The Academy grows concerned over the recent metallization of large swathes of forest on the northern hemisphere. This rare condition, caused by fusion-powered microorganisms, quickly turns all foliage to metal alloy.{NEWLINE}'It's a sight to behold', says Lab Technician Rhonda Vallis from The Academy. 'A coniferous forest rendered in steel, including the trees, the grass, even mistletoe. Although the trees are no longer able to photosynthesize, they still grow thanks to the enormous energy stored in their cells.'{NEWLINE}Unfortunately, beautiful as they may be, these 'steel forests' carry large amounts of energy and may explode violently when damaged. Forest fires are particularly dangerous, as they easily make trees go critical and detonate, spreading the damage further.{NEWLINE}All citizens are strongly discouraged from approaching such areas. Let the professionals deal with it!","STR_NEWSPAPER_010":"Food Pirates Strike Again","STR_NEWSPAPER_010_UFOPEDIA":"Today at 06:50 local time, a Guild train carrying soy was deliberately derailed in Dark Dominion, with no casualties.{NEWLINE}The terrorist attack is believed to be linked to the recent introduction of Zero Tolerance policy by the government in Hope, in accord with the Traders Guild, against so-called 'food pirates' - farmers who use unauthorised seeds to plant their crops. Such illegal seeds are sought after due to their low price, but the lack of proper screening against genetic anomalies and possible contamination pose a great risk to all consumers. The Guild appeals to the citizens for listening to reason and buying authorised, good seeds instead of risking their lives over a few credits.{NEWLINE}The perpetrators of the train attack are still on the run.","STR_NEWSPAPER_011":"Metal Will Miss The Finals","STR_NEWSPAPER_011_UFOPEDIA":"To the horror of all fans, Michael 'Metal Mike' Grendahl, 22, from Iron Tribe's national Gravball representation, Meteor Kings, was seriously injured during training. While his long-term health is not in danger, multiple limb injuries and a torn lung prevent him from participating in the finals.{NEWLINE}Metal Mike, captain of the team, is universally beloved for his finishing move 'Iron Bear Hook', developed to score both a point and a K.O. with one strike. Now the crowd seems rather desperate with him not going to the finals, where his talents would be invaluable when facing Blackmarch.{NEWLINE}'Bollocks', says his Coach Siffredi, 41. 'The boy needed a break anyway. All of it, went to his head. It would never happen in my Romanica', he explained. Even so, it's a tough year for the Iron Tribe's team: first their captain is Taken by the Star Gods, then his replacement gets himself mangled. Will they be able to defend their championship? Even if not, we do expect they'll make it to the finals, for another battle with their arch-nemesis, Blackmarch's Black Sabers.","STR_NEWSPAPER_012":"Inquistor Kashub: Good or Bad Cop?","STR_NEWSPAPER_012_UFOPEDIA":"Well, torture is a complex art, but the basics I learned on my first year, are really quite easy. Your worst enemy is defiance. Don't do anything to bolster that emotion, like by making the client hate you. You need to intimidate them instead. Everyone has some secret fantasy of domination. Some want pleasure, some want direction, some want understanding. But first, you have to shake the client up. A few methods exist, choose one you feel most fitting the client - one is by cold water, other by stripping and restraining, another is plain old beating up. Then you start applying verbal and physical stimuli, like poking them with a stick, to scare and please them in turns, so they'll feel inclined to pleasing you back by answering questions. If they go into shock, some lashing will bring them back to reality. Most will eventually tell you their little secrets. Some will remain argumentative. These are beyond help and deserve punishment like they were real criminals. Yes, simpletons say brute force always works best, but the Inquisition cannot go around murdering innocent witnesses, that'd make people less helpful to us.","STR_NEWSPAPER_013":"The Attack Of Violent Flare Females","STR_NEWSPAPER_013_UFOPEDIA":"'It was horrible', says Moore Moorman, an eyewitness to the carnage. 'They were shooting people left and right, setting everything on fire, howling like wild beasts, there must have been no more than a dozen of them but it seemed like a hundred. Big, burly females armed to the teeth. But what really scared me out of my mind was the flares. It was incomprehensible - amid the whole chaos, they were throwing flares; at corpses, at each other, everywhere, as if they were having fun. This wasn't natural, I tell you.'{NEWLINE}This recent attack is just another one of a string of violent robberies and kidnappings committed by this new, strange gang. There is still no confirmation on who they might be, but their apparent (and quite impossible) global reach, coupled with the extreme danger they pose, suggest conspiracy, false flag, or other distraction. The flares must be just a part of this psy op, serving no other purpose than to advertise it and spread confusion. The only question is, what major power stands behind this diabolical deception?","STR_NEWSPAPER_014":"Special Interview: Inquisitor Kashub","STR_NEWSPAPER_014_UFOPEDIA":"It is a rare occasion when we can have the pleasure of talking to a celebrity as distinguished as Dr. Kashub, an Inquisitor of the Church. Our guest entertained us with stories of his youth as a Spartan kid and how he had seen the light after a theological dispute with his superior (who lost the dispute, among other things). As a member of the Church special forces, Dr. Kashub has seen countless horrors and learned about the human heart, which allowed him to  eventually assume the inquisitorial mantle and continue his effort of 'purging the unwashed' from the face of our planet. When asked how he manages to stay sane despite witnessing such terrible things, he stated that 'It's much easier when you see the world through rosy glasses', while putting his trademark pink vision aids on.","STR_NEWSPAPER_015":"Biocock Insanity","STR_NEWSPAPER_015_UFOPEDIA":"There's a new deadly weapon on the market and it has the most unexpected form: a rooster. These 'biococks' are fully robotic under their living tissue and they are programmed to kill for their masters. There are already several reports of marauding bands of Ratmen using herds of these cybernetic weapons to attack towns.{NEWLINE}'It is unclear who is behind these mechanical nightmares', explains detective Fong. 'But we have some solid leads and will capture the perpetrators shortly. After all these machines are not only deadly, but also deemed forbidden by Star Gods!'{NEWLINE}Good luck, detective! But whoever it is, we know they are completely insane.","STR_NEWSPAPER_016":"The Rejuvenation Ceremony","STR_NEWSPAPER_016_UFOPEDIA":"Like this time every year, the streets of Jerusalem have filled with pilgrims, coming from all parts of the world to participate in this holiest of Church's celebrations. The most striking is the contrast between that colorful throng and the stern faces of Theban female soldier-clones, who have been securing the premises since Jerusalem fell into the Theban fold a few years ago.{NEWLINE}'There's no enmity at all', exclaims Celebras Primas John Wando. 'All living creatures are children of the Stars and everyone can see the light! The path to enlightenment is open to all, from the lowliest to the finest, as long as they, whatever their daily toils might be, follow the path of self-improvement. It is through the natural path that we rise from the mud of our creation towards the light of the stars, in this life and all the others. Blessed be the Star Gods, who, being so enlightened themselves, choose to help our lowly planet to follow the path of glory, instead of drowning in pain, sickness and confusion like many civilizations that had fallen before. Anyone is welcome to celebrate with us!","STR_NEWSPAPER_017":"Replicator Outbreak in Siberia","STR_NEWSPAPER_017_UFOPEDIA":"A local warlord, Armok, also known as 'God of Blood', caused quite a stir on the Eurasian Autonomy's border when he crossed into the country with what turned out to be remains of his followers, turned into self-replicating weapons, and proceeded to attack townships, thus swelling the ranks of his 'army'. The authorities were slow to act, since the last known outbreak of the Necron_Vampire 1.0 Replicator happened over 200 years ago, which for many is little more than an age of myths, it seems. Thankfully, local militia from the Witchaven area put an end to the situation before it could claim more lives. As the replicating swarm (with Armok in the centre of it) advanced across the countryside, it was easy to spot, so they napalm-bombed it from the air, using their archaic jetfighters. As Aviation Colonel Zhabov, who was the commander of the operation, put it, 'thankfully these self-replicators don't have the capability to reach too many z-levels up'.","STR_NEWSPAPER_018":"Phobos Hits the Charts","STR_NEWSPAPER_018_UFOPEDIA":"The Cybermites are already a legend on the robe rock scene, and the spectacular success of its new album 'Dark Side of Phobos' may well skyrocket them even higher! The album is a modern retelling of the classic tale of Knights of Cydonia, ancient Earthlings who were the first to answer the Star Gods call and pledged loyalty to them on Mars, where they went in a makeshift vessel. As the group's frontman explained, it provides the most enticing story to tell, with all its action, conflict, spirituality and rich characters, and therefore made perfect material for music.{NEWLINE}'It was a very hard task', he said, 'but I think we nailed it. We've never learned so much before, but it was also great fun.'{NEWLINE}If you haven't been to their concert yet, or you want to repeat the experience, then watch out for The Cybermites' world tour that starts next month! And now there is also talk about a new Cydonia movie, so... stay entertained!","STR_NEWSPAPER_019":"Rogue Leaflets Attack Steel Pact","STR_NEWSPAPER_019_UFOPEDIA":"The streets of Memory of Earth are terrified of the recent propaganda attacks, where an as-yet-unidentified terrorist group struck the very heart of the city. The attack was executed with hundreds of thousands of adhesive posters with only two words on them, 'ZANDER LIVES', and a mysterious symbol. The posters turned out to be much more than paper and glue: they fed on organic waste, which is ubiquitous in the area, then multiplied and went looking for any vertical flat surface to stick onto, obviously causing panic along the way. Fortunately they were mostly harmless to humans, except for several distressed individuals who had to have their hair cut to free them from the demonic posters.{NEWLINE}The local government is unable to tell at this point if this attack was politically motivated or some other sort of crime. In any case, if you hear about a person named Zander, or know anything about the attack, please report to the nearest Marsec office to collect a reward of up to $5,000.","STR_NEWSPAPER_020":"Pectoids: Threat or Hoax?","STR_NEWSPAPER_020_UFOPEDIA":"Horror and panic have gripped the borough of Edinburg, Iron Tribe. The locals are reluctant to leave their homes after dark for fear of so-called 'Pectoids', animalistic creatures resembling Reticulans but possessed of great physical agility and aggression. As the locals have it, they glow in the dark with unholy light and leap to claw and bite their victims to slake their thirst of blood. The Academy has already issued a statement, informing that Pectoid sightings have been reported in various places for decades, and an investigation of every house in Edinburg would be a good idea. The Iron Tribe government, however, stubbornly refuses to give permission to do so. The Courier was able to interrogate a Reticulan who was recently arrested in Edinburg for Immoral Behaviour. 'Man, there are no Pectoids' said Mr. Dunk. 'We were simply so high on Atom Beer that we were glowing.

To many, this sparsely populated expanse is synonymous with romantic ideals of freedom and unbounded imagination. Reasonable people know it to be largely untrue, and the Wasteland is rife with danger and contain little of interest, no more than your familiar city-border shantytown can offer. And if one really wants to travel it, there are job openings in the Guild, Academy and other organizations, allowing you to fulfill your dreams while doing constructive work.{NEWLINE}However not many know or believe in the great evils that plague the most dangerous parts of the Wasteland: the notorious Narlock and Lokk'Naar tribes, the worst barbarians of all, grown rich on crime, and indulging in every villainy imaginable, like cannibalism, ritual child rape, human sacrifice and torture. These traits are shared by various mercenaries they employ, chief amongst them the little-known and horrendously mutated Ubers, through whose veins runs insanity, making them completely devoid of morality or respect for life.","STR_NEWSPAPER_023":"Xenophobia and Xenophilia","STR_NEWSPAPER_023_UFOPEDIA":"It has been many centuries since the Earth became a part of Galactic civilization, yet our attitude towards it, sadly, remains largely cave-age. 'We should not be afraid of aliens,' says Inquisitor Kashub. 'Fear breeds hatred, so does ignorance. Aliens can be strange, disgusting, even despicable to our narrow minds, but in most cases this is just a question of the lack of tolerance and understanding. The one most despicable thing in the universe is xenophobia, and very few spacefaring civilizations are inflicted with this disease, since if they did, they likely would have long ago destroyed themselves in warfare. Let's not become known as a rare black sheep in this big family of life. Remember, just like we struggle to understand aliens, so they struggle to understand us, let's not assume the lack of goodwill on their part, or, even worse, our own superiority.

Such a question might sound benign, but nothing can be more deceiving! Before our Academy was established, science had been in the hands of males for countless centuries. After overthrowing the original Matriarchate, power-hungry and sexually-frustrated males kept devising horrors of war and soulless, environment-polluting machines, culminating in the unforgivable Uranus Bomb.

'It is a supreme honour to address you today on behalf of the Elder Ones.' proclaimed His Holiness to bottomless applause, 'As children of the stars, whether pureblood, mutant or xeno, we all come together as one family united and directed by their most benevolent guidance. When we act in solidarity nothing can stand between or against us. Blessed are the works of the Masters! Eternal is their rule!'

First mutants were either created by space plagues that swept away the Old Earth, or were lifted into the skies by the Star Gods directly to be altered and returned to Earth. Narlocks and Lokk'Naars came into being at roughly the same time, but quite differently. The legend has it they were taken deep underground, and mutated by the Dragons. The mythical reptiles bestowed upon them their wisdom and tenacity, then deserted their creation in favor of other, unfathomable pursuits. Since then, both peoples came to develop their own identities, neither reptillian nor human, Lokk'Naars embracing the curse of Darkness (also called Lokk'Naar), while Narlocks striving to ascend into the Light.","STR_GODS_SUMMARY":"Lokk'Naar and Narlock beliefs","STR_GODS_SUMMARY_UC":"Neru & Loki","STR_GODS_SUMMARY_UFOPEDIA":"Both Narlocks and Lokk'Naars revere 2 supreme spirits/ideals.

This brings him adulation of his worshippers, who are proud to have such a peerless tyrant.","STR_GODS_E2_UFOPEDIA":"The Goddess of Love and Alchemy, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. Her aspects are Greed and Gluttony. She gives everything and demands everything. She considers herself pure, brave, humble, honest, diligent and generous, which she sees as Virtues that make a Soul. As the Demonic Cook she says that you will be consumed; a virtuous Soul will humbly accept such devouring, and be reborn; an empty Soul, devoid of Love, will be torn to pieces. She wants her worshippers to consume her, as well.","STR_GODS_E3_UFOPEDIA":"The God of Death and Carnival, the God of Trickery and Truth, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. Life is Carnival, Death is a Joke. He favors those who don't get fooled by immaterial illusions. Nothing amuses him as much as death caused by Hubris, and, being a mischievous god, he enjoys fuelling people's delusions of grandeur, so that the Universe, which is the Endless Graveyard, will cut them down.

She is the Black Knight, and she protects the order in the Demonic Kingdom and collects taxes.

As a deity linked to cats, she holds particular contempt for those possessed by the spirits of mice.","STR_GODS_E5_UFOPEDIA":"One of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon. He's an uncaring power, the God of Fire, worshipped by many, but bringing only ruin to those who invoke his name light-heartedly.

He is the iron law of the universe that destroys delusions, the might that lets even the lowliest defeat the greatest, if wielded right. The Lokk'Naar Festival of Fire reminds everyone of his crucial role to any civilization.","STR_GODS_E6_UFOPEDIA":"The Goddess of the Hunt, one of the 8 Demon Gods of the Lokk'Naar pantheon.
